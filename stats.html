                    Shifters have a little more variation to them, depending on their lycropanthic heritage.
                    They all share the ability to change between their humanoid and animalistic forms once per long or short rest (level +
                    Con in temp HP),
                    have darkvision to 60ft, and have the normal languages from their home. Their humanoid appearances tend towards
                    Human, Half-Orc and Half-Elf, while the animal side varies.

                    <p>
                        Warforged were built with specific jobs in mind. This is something to keep in mind when creating
                        one wether its to keep the thematics in line, or to subvert them. The UA version, had subtypes, 
                        but the official release is simply flexible, similarly to a human. All Warforged have +1 AC and
                        the ability to incorporate armor into their bodies.
