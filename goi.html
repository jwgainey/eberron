        <h2>Houses</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Houses typically do not hire outside help beyond extra muscle, but frequently have employment opportunities.
                    This can range from adventurers on retainer, agents for internal issues, or even simply waged employees. 
                    Houses typically pay 10X the party's level g per day on a job and will offer a 10% discount on that House's   
                    services. If employed by the Twelve, you receive a 5% discount from all House Services. 
                </p>
            </div> <!-- Houses-->

        <h2>Churches</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Most religious institutions have less than favorable views on the undead and other monstrous types, and so are called upon frequently to deal with these issues. 
                    This is a rather common problem and so many churches will hire out adventures to help with the dirty work. They typically do not give additional payment beyond
                    the rewards received, but do offer services in healing and restoration (when available) for free, something that can add up quickly for the adventuring lifestyle.
                    Frequently working under a church may offer a more permanent employment opportunity, very similar in structure to a government agency or military outfit. Any 
                    religious institution can act as a patron, with the Church of the Silver Flame being the most prominent.

        <h2>Crime Syndicates</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    There is quite a bit of criminal activity in Khorvaire, ranging from bribery, protection rackets, smuggling, thievery, and even assassination. For 
                    obvious reasons, these groups prefer to act more subtly than other organizations, despite often having some sort of alliance with the local law 
                    enforcement or administration. Membership is only ever given by other members offering an invitation and being assessed by the local leader. If rejected,
                    the outfit will rarely kill, but definitely give threats that they will absolutely make good on. Unless you take on a regular position such as a bodyguard,
                    the Syndicates do not directly pay you, but split shares of the job you have taken on, typically around your 85% to their 15%. You also have access to 
                    illegal goods that may be difficult to find elsewhere. You also have access to a fence, who is able to sell and procure various goods for you, although this 
                    removes your ability to negotiate prices. Many groups own legitimate businesses as well, and this will give you a small discount on their goods and services.
                    Examples of crime syndicates include the Boromar Clan and House Tarkanan of Sharn and Daask of Droaam.

        <h2>Universities</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Places of higher learning include not only the education system, but the libraries and museums as well. Most of the time these are requests for artifacts, rare 
                    materials, or sometimes to simply verify information. These tend to be lengthy and dangerous excursions, hence hiring the muscle so to say, instead of having 
                    educators on extended leave. Payment is typically in form of bounties on the job itself, but sometimes a salary of 1g per day is offered for groups to be on 
                    retainer for the university in question. This also allows free access to the troves of information afforded by the school, and even vastly reduced pricing
                    on various classes. Morgrave University is the most likely to hire adventurers, but the Library of Korranburg and University of Wyarn are known to as well.

        <h2>Journalism/Investigation</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Free speech is across Khorvaire, only limited by what is able to be physically shared (some regions simply don't have easy access, limiting 
                    what information they can give and receive). There are several widely distributed newspapers, whose popularity boomed during the war. As a 
                    whole, they have an expansive network of informative contacts and press passes enable ease of access to nearly anywhere they wish. The passes
                    also offer some protection against certain groups, or perhaps as a target for others. Known mostly for news reports and exposes, many papers
                    also publish serialized pulp stories and games as well. Members of the press gain massive discounts from House 
                    Orien's railways and House Sivis's communications, sometimes even simply being billed to the corresponding paper. As long as you or your group 
                    regularly sends things to be published, you each receive 1g per day and many expenses can be reimbursed. 
                    The most popular papers are the Korranburg Chronicle and the Voice of Breland. If you wish, you may start your own periodical as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Newspapers also frequently work with detective agencies, sharing information generally helping each other out, unless something need to be kept
                    out of the public for a time first. Agents are typically hired on a as needed basis at rates from 5s to 10s per day in addition to expenses. Many 
                    are available for private contract work, with very few only offering their services to law enforcement or the government. This is another organization
                    that can be founded by the party.

        <h2>Government Agencies</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Governmental agencies, commonly espionage or intelligence agencies, will occasionally look outside their groups to 
                    offer employment to those who seem talented in those fields. Your group typically gets access to an account, limiting your 
                    usage to 100g per member per month for day to day expenses in addition to the payment of the job itself. It is allowed to 
                    go over that limit, but you will be audited and may be required to pay the difference. If abuse of this system is frequent,
                    you may be cut off from the account. Compared to other patrons, you have little say in declining work from Agencies.
                    Possible ones to join are the Trust in Zilgaro and the Dark Lanterns in Breland. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Sometimes a group may work directly for a ruler or governmental body, typically as a 'special forces' of sorts. Working 
                    directly for the heads of state tends to bring a great deal of authority to your encounters and some actions may be overlooked. 
                    Like with an agency, you have little say in your jobs, typically being on call for assignment. Due to this you have a daily 
                    salary of 1g, on the job or not, and you are reimbursed for most routine expenditures while on duty. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Militaries are also an option. Your absolute obedience is expected, but you do receive up to 20% discounts on equipment, and free 
                    food and lodging in barracks or forts (of which there are many). You also have a 1s per day salary, both on and off duty. Promotions
                    bring in a larger pay check, of course.

        <h2>Adventurer's Guilds</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Various guilds dot Khorvaire ranging in size from a dozen or so to upwards of 200. Guilds do not directly hire out 
                    services, but act as a gathering place for adventurers to meet and share information. Those looking to hire will typically
                    bring their job to a guild master who then lets whoever wants sign up for job, only sometimes directly choosing a group,
                    depending on the situation.Most guilds require sponsorship to join, which usually just involves an okay from several members 
                    after a display of ability, fame can circumvent this, depending on need. Since they do not take a cut of a job's pay, membership requires a yearly dues.
                    Membership offers services 
                    in addition to jobs such as lodging and storage at a lower rate, but similar quality, to commercial versions. Membership often 
                    times brings discounts from local shops as well. Most guilds are allied with each other, enabling benefits even if not a direct 
                    member, but bitter rivalries also exist between certain guilds. The most famous and largest guilds are the Clifftop Adventurer's 
                    Guild and Deathsgate Explorer's Club in Sharn and the Wayfinder's Guild in Fairhaven.

            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Those with arcane and divine aptitude may find themselves entering deals with magical entities on their adventures. Sometimes this 
                    may manifest in a Patron as with a Warlock, but can also form as a more mundane arrangement. Tasks assigned by these forces tend to 
                    revolve around finding lost magical items, protecting areas, and sometimes eliminating a certain threat. Jobs are typically not paid,
                    but these adventures will often have great shares of treasures to be found. Depending on the patron themselves, they may also reward 
                    in additional treasures, secrets, or even magical abilities. Patrons under this category include the Lords of Dust, The Chamber, Sora 
                    Kell, and druidic circles.

        <h2>THe Aurum</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    This social club of some of the most rich and influential members of Khorvaire. It started as a counter measure of sorts for smaller 
                    businesses to survive against the monopolies of the great Houses. Although exclusive, membership ranges from most economical and cultural
                    backgrounds, primarily focusing on how much potential an individual has. Members range from farmers, to businessmen and from crime lords
                    to union representatives. There are even a few ex-House members in its fold today. Overall the Aurum is known for much of the charity work
                    throughout the continent, actually being one of the biggest forces behind the increase in public education. While mostly benevolent, there 
                    are many conspiracy theories involving plans to usurp the governments and destroy the Houses for good. This may have some credence due to 
                    Aurum's seeming unity during the war, with many divisions only forming during peacetime. Members have a tendency towards collecting rare 
                    works throughout the world, sometimes putting them at odds with universities for procurement of these artifacts. Others may look for 
                    evidence of wrongdoings by the Houses. Membership may be a ways off for an aspiring group of adventurers, but in the meantime, there are 
                    loads of business opportunities for those who keep an eye out.

                <p>
                    The Dragons of Argonnessen have not been seen in over a millennium, cloistering themselves away to study the Dragon Prophecy. While many 
                    people know this, few know what this truly means. The Prophecy is able to predict nearly every event that has happened and will happen. 
                    This are interpreted through the stars, weather patterns and other divining methods and compared to strange carved monoliths that have 
                    existed since the dawn of time. The Chamber decide which course of actions are the best and try to prevent or ensure certain outcomes. 
                    While this is not common knowledge by any means, it seems to remain as a very popular conspiracy theory involving the Dragons secretly
                    ruling the world. Chances are you may be hired by emissaries of The Chamber without ever knowing it or the consequences of your quest.

                <p>
                    Similarly to The Chamber, the Lords of Dust also interpret the Dragon Prophecy to their own agenda. Theirs however are leading to the 
                    freedom of their demonic Overlords, imprisoned by the Dragons and Couatl so long ago. The agents are mostly Rakshasa, a type of 
                    shapeshifting demon known for their dangerous cunning. Many conspiracy theories revolve around dark cabal as well. Most of these are 
                    in the form of being the secret power behind many of Eberron's affluent organizations. The Lords also prefer to act in the background,
                    sometimes employing intrepid heros to do their dark bidding with the party being none the wiser.
