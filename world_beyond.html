        <h2>Foreign Lands</h2>
        <p>The lands beyond Khorvaire are much different. While Khorvaire is a melting pot of the various 
            cultures and people throughout the world, most other continents are comparitivly singular in 
            their cultures.Trade is reaching new hights, especially now that it has been some time after the 
            war has ended. Some immigration has taken place, but in general it seems to flow to Khorvaire more
            than the opposite.

        <h2>Arenal</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ruler: The Undying Cour</li>
                <li>Governance: Ancestoral Council</li>
                <li>Cities: Shae Mordai</li>
                <li>Languages: Elven</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The birthplace of Elves. Arenal is widely known for its use of positive-aligned necromancy and its 
            population of undead citizens. Their blief system involves reincarnating and trying again so to say 
            untill you are deemed virtous enough to be brought back as a deathless. Further merits allows one to 
            the Undying Court, the leader on both physical and spiritual matters. Their interactions with the 
            outside worl was typically being hired as mercenaries, leading to colonization and immigration to Khorvaire.
            Today, they mainly focus on trade, selling exotic fruits and spices, and the ever valuable floatwood.

        <h2>Argonnessen</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ruler: The Chamber</li>
                <li>Governance: Democracy</li>
                <li>Cities: Dragon Reach</li>
                <li>Languages: Draconic, Celestial</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The land of Dragons. After the Demon War, dragons and the few surviving coatls made there home in the isolated
            island of Argonnessen. It was here that the dragons discovered great monothiths with intricate carvings detailing
            past events, as well a present ones. Some that were loosly translated came to pass, so many of the Dragons have devoted
            their time to translating and understanding these monoliths to protect the future. The events yet to pass are often 
            unclear, and evidence supports that they are not always clear untill they do pass. The Dragons prefer to work and live in 
            isolation, but will sometimes give invitations to outsiders for a monitered visit. They rarely leave Argonnessen, unless 
            it is for a specific perpose regarding a proficy. It is rumored that nearly, if not all creatures from this island are 
            other types of dragonkin.

        <h2>Sarlona</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ruler: The Inspired/ Kalashtar Elders</li>
                <li>Governance: Totalitarian State/ Monastic Traditions</li>
                <li>Cities: New Port</li>
                <li>Languages: Reidran,Common/ Telepathy</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Sarlona is the orginal home of humans. They are by far the most populous race with most others almost unheard of in the continent.
            The continent of is a little bigger than Khorvaire and just as geographically diverse. It conisists of two countries
            constantly at odds with one another, Reidra and Adar. Reidra is extremely insular, having only one port city open to the outside world.
            Only Humans, Changelings, and Giantkin are allowed within the country proper. Kalashtar are executed on site. This port city is the only
            window into Reiran life, the laws here must be followed to the letter otherwise perpetrators are delt with extreme prejudice. The Reidran
            merchants are known to pay top dollar for relativly easy to procure wears, so many Khorvarians seek out trad here for a quick buck.    
        </p>
        <p>The country of Adar is nearly inhospitable, geographically. It is filled with treacherous mountains and is beseiged by near constant storms.
            It is here that the psionic humans known as Kalashtar are from. It is belived that Kalashtar were once normal humans, but have bound their 
            souls with dream spirits, enabling a sort of ancestral psychic link. They are hated by the Reidrans due to their belief in another sect of
            dream spirits who are at odds with the Kalashtar's. It is through both group's psionic abilities that there is even evidence of a sort of 
            psychic plane that may be related to a myth of the Giants severing connection to a lost moon.

        <h2>Xen'drik</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ruler: Local Matriarchs</li>
                <li>Governance: Matriarchal Clans</li>
                <li>Cities: Villages and Outposts</li>
                <li>Languages: Giant</li>
            </ul>

        <p>The legendary home of Giants. In ancient times Giant society ruled supreme. They were well beyond today in terms of technology and magic.
            they altered the course of evolution for some races, believed to have 'created' the Drow who now populate the continent. Legends state that 
            there was once a thirteenth plane and moon of psychic energy that became corrupted by nightamre spirits. In a great war against this incorpreal
            foe, the Giants used powerful magic to destroy this moon and forever sever the plane from the world. Their succssess however, threw the balance
            of the plance off and they shortly disapeared after, leaving their creations behind. Except for villages across the northern coastlines, the rest  
            of the continent is presumably, uninhabited. A few outposts from Khorvarian exploration parties have been buitl, but due to the region's nature, 
            they have been left unrecovered. The entire coninent, except again for the northern coastlines, are constantly shifting, making reliable mapmaking 
            an impossible task. Some believe this is due to lingering magic from the severing of an entire plane.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Frostfell and Everice</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ruler: none</li>
                <li>Governance: none</li>
                <li>Cities: Ghostlight, Mirror Peak</li>
                <li>Languages: Common</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>The largely unexplored arctic and antartic regions of the world. Explorations into the northern Frostfell have been
            much more succssessful than in Everice, with a couple of outpost towns still in operation. Expeditions are getting less frequent
            even though there is some evidence of civilization, possibly Dwarvish further north. As is stands, Everice seems completly 
            devoid of life barring the sole outpost station and reports of a lone creature further in the wastes. As of now, any 
            exploration is deemed a waste of life and money. 
        </p><br>

        <h2>Kyber</h2>
        <p>The underground labrynth of caverns spanning the entire world. Named after the Proginator Dragon who betrayed her siblings,
            these twisting tunnels make very little sense spacially. Caves that seem to have dead ends can bring you to a different location 
            when leaving, paths that take weeks to months above ground takes mere days underground, and some caverns are much larger than they
            should be, lining up with the above world. Despite these spacial anomolies,
            the paths throughout seem to stay consistant. It is believed that roughly 5% has been explored so far, with more expeditions being 
            very few and far between. Exploring known entrances to Kyber is considered a sort of taboo, only even being slightly tolerated because
            of dragonshard mining. The taboo comes from not only its strange nature and associations with the Dragon, but to belief that fiends 
            from the beginnings of time, the Daelkyr and their abberant creations, and possibly even worse evils are sealed away in its twisting 
            corridors.
