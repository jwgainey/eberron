                        The lands beyond Khorvaire are much different than what the Khorvar are used to. While 
                        Khorvaire is a melting pot of the various 
                        cultures and people throughout the world, most other continents are comparatively singular in 
                        their cultures. Trade is reaching new hights, especially now that it has been some time after the 
                        war has ended. Some immigration has taken place, but in general it seems to flow to Khorvaire more
                        than the opposite.

                    The birthplace of Elven civilization. Arenal is widely known for its use of positive-aligned necromancy and its 
                    population of undead citizens. Their belief system involves reincarnating and trying again so to say 
                    until you are deemed virtuous enough to be brought back as a deathless. Further merits allows one to 
                    the Undying Court, the leader on both physical and spiritual matters. Their interactions with the 
                    outside world was typically being hired as mercenaries, leading to colonization and immigration to Khorvaire.
                    Today, they mainly focus on trade, selling exotic fruits and spices, and the ever valuable floatwood.

                <p>The land of Dragons. After the Demon War, dragons and the few surviving coatls made there home in the isolated
                    island of Argonnessen. It was here that the dragons discovered great monoliths with intricate carvings detailing
                    past events, as well a present ones. Some that were loosely translated came to pass, so many of the Dragons have devoted
                    their time to translating and understanding these monoliths to protect the future. The events yet to pass are often 
                    unclear, and evidence supports that they are not always clear until they do pass. The Dragons prefer to work and live in 
                    isolation, but will sometimes give invitations to outsiders for a monitored visit. They rarely leave Argonnessen, unless 
                    it is for a specific purpose regarding a prophicy. It is rumored that nearly, if not all creatures from this island are 
                    other types of dragonkin.

                    Sarlona is the original home of humans. In fact, other than giant-kin the other races are nearly unheard of within the continent.
                    Sarlona is a little bigger than Khorvaire and just as geographically diverse. It consists of two countries
                    constantly at odds with one another, Reidra and Adar. Reidra is extremely insular, having only one port city open to the outside world.
                    Only Humans, Changelings, and giant-kin are allowed within the country proper. Kalashtar are executed on site. This port city is the only
                    window into Reiran life, the laws here must be followed to the letter otherwise perpetrators are delt with extreme prejudice. The Reidran
                    merchants are known to pay top dollar for relatively easy to procure wears, so many Khorvarians seek out trad here for a quick buck.    
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The country of Adar is nearly inhospitable. It is filled with treacherous mountains and is besieged by constant storms, with only a single valley
                    offering respite.
                    It is here that the psionic humans known as Kalashtar are descended. It is believed that Kalashtar were once normal humans, but have bound their 
                    souls with dream spirits, enabling a sort of ancestral psychic link. They are hated by the Reidrans due to their inability to annex Adar and possible 
                    influence of the dream spirits.
                    It is through both group's psionic abilities that there is even evidence of a 
                    psychic plane, believed to be related to the destroyed moon.

                <p>
                    The legendary home of Giants. In ancient times Giant society ruled supreme. They were well beyond today in terms of technology and magic.
                    they altered the course of evolution for some races, believed to have 'created' the Drow who now populate the continent. Legends state that 
                    there was once a thirteenth plane and moon of psychic energy that became corrupted by nightmare spirits. In a great war against this incorporeal
                    foe, the Giants used powerful magic to destroy this moon and forever sever the plane from the world. Their successes however, threw the balance
                    of the planes off and they shortly disappeared after, leaving their creations behind. Except for villages across the northern coastlines, the rest  
                    of the continent is presumably, uninhabited. A few outposts from Khorvarian exploration parties have been built, but due to the region's nature, 
                    they have been left un-recovered. The entire continent, except again for the northern coastlines, are constantly shifting, making reliable mapmaking 
                    an impossible task. Some believe this is due to lingering magic from the severing of an entire plane.

                    The largely unexplored arctic and antarctic regions of the world. Explorations into the northern Frostfell have been
                    much more successful than in Everice, with a couple of outpost towns still in operation. Expeditions are getting less frequent
                    even though there is some evidence of civilization, possibly Dwarvish further north. As is stands, Everice seems completely 
                    devoid of life barring the sole outpost station and reports of strange creatures further in the wastes. As of now, any further
                    exploration is deemed a waste of life and money.

                <p>
                    The underground labyrinth of caverns spanning the entire world. Named after the Progenitor Dragon who betrayed her siblings,
                    these twisting tunnels make very little sense spatially. Caves that seem to have dead ends can bring you to a different location 
                    when leaving, paths that take weeks to months above ground takes mere days underground, and some caverns are much larger than they
                    should be, lining up with the above world. Despite these spacial anomalies,
                    the paths throughout seem to stay consistent. It is believed that roughly 5% has been explored so far, with more expeditions being 
                    very few and far between. Exploring known entrances to Kyber is considered a sort of taboo, only even being slightly tolerated because
                    of dragonshard mining. The taboo comes from not only its strange nature and associations with the Dragon, but to belief that fiends 
                    from the beginnings of time, the Daelkyr and their aberrant creations, and possibly even worse evils are sealed away in its twisting 
                    corridors.
