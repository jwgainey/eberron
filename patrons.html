            <h2 class="text-center mb-3">Group Patrons</h2>
            <div class="info-block mb-5">
                <p>
                    Group Patrons act as an employer for the party. Most offer a steadier income, if not an outright
                    salary rather than just rewards or loot. Depending on the individual Patron, this could lower your
                    own autonomy when adventuring, often giving limits on what you can or cannot do, or giving
                    additional objectives to your own. The benefits include having much easier access to important
                    contacts and resources than if you were strictly independent. You may incorporate the Patrons to
                    your backstories, although I would not recommend having more than two active Patrons for the party
                    as a whole, that would lead to conflicting goals, and add more red tape, bogging down the game most
                    likely. Another option is to freelance for these Patrons, they commonly have jobs for people outside
                    their groups, but you simply won't have some of the better benefits as being in their fold.

            <h3 class="text-center mb-3">Houses</h3>
            <div class="info-block mb-5">
                <p>
                    Houses typically do not hire outside help beyond extra muscle, but frequently have employment
                    opportunities.
                    This can range from adventurers on retainer, agents for internal issues, or even simply waged
                    employees.
                    Houses typically pay 10X the party's level in gp per day on a job and will offer a 10% discount on
                    that House's
                    services. If employed by the Twelve, you receive a 5% discount from all House Services.

            <h3 class="text-center mb-3">Churches</h3>
            <div class="info-block mb-5">
                <p>
                    Most religious institutions have less than favorable views on the undead and other monstrous types,
                    and so are called upon frequently to deal with these issues.
                    This is a rather common problem and so many churches will hire out adventures to help with the dirty
                    work. They typically do not give additional payment beyond
                    the rewards received, but do offer services in healing and restoration (when available) for free,
                    something that can add up quickly for the adventuring lifestyle.
                    Frequently working under a church may offer a more permanent employment opportunity, very similar in
                    structure to a government agency or military outfit. Any
                    religious institution can act as a patron, with the Church of the Silver Flame being the most
                    prominent.

            <h3 class="text-center mb-3">Crime Syndicates</h3>
            <div class="info-block mb-5">
                <p>
                    There is quite a bit of criminal activity in Khorvaire, ranging from bribery, protection rackets,
                    smuggling, thievery, and even assassination. For
                    obvious reasons, these groups prefer to act more subtly than other organizations, despite often
                    having some sort of alliance with the local law
                    enforcement or administration. Membership is only ever given by other members offering an invitation
                    and being assessed by the local leader. If rejected,
                    the outfit will rarely kill, but definitely give threats that they will absolutely make good on.
                    Unless you take on a regular position such as a bodyguard,
                    the Syndicates do not directly pay you, but split shares of the job you have taken on, typically
                    around your 85% to their 15%. You also have access to
                    illegal goods that may be difficult to find elsewhere. You also have access to a fence, who is able
                    to sell and procure various goods for you, although this
                    removes your ability to negotiate prices. Many groups own legitimate businesses as well, and this
                    will give you a small discount on their goods and services.
                    Examples of crime syndicates include the Boromar Clan and House Tarkanan of Sharn and Daask of
                    Droaam.

                    Places of higher learning include not only the education system, but libraries and museums as well.
                    Most of the time these are requests for artifacts, rare
                    materials, or sometimes to simply verify information. These tend to be lengthy and dangerous
                    excursions, hence hiring the muscle so to say, instead of having
                    educators on extended leave. Payment is typically in form of bounties on the job itself, but
                    sometimes a salary of 1g per day is offered for groups to be on
                    retainer for the university in question. This also allows free access to the troves of information
                    afforded by the school, and even vastly reduced pricing
                    on various classes. Morgrave University is the most likely to hire adventurers, but the Library of
                    Korranburg and University of Wyarn are known to as well.

                <p>
                    Free speech is protected across Khorvaire, only limited by what is able to be physically shared
                    (some regions simply don't have easy access, limiting
                    what information they can give and receive). There are several widely distributed newspapers, whose
                    popularity boomed during the war. As a
                    whole, they have an expansive network of informative contacts and press passes enable ease of access
                    to nearly anywhere they wish. The passes
                    also offer some protection against certain groups, or perhaps as a target for others. Known mostly
                    for news reports and exposes, many papers
                    also publish serialized pulp stories and games as well. Members of the press gain massive discounts
                    from House
                    Orien's railways and House Sivis's communications, sometimes even simply being billed to the
                    corresponding paper. As long as you or your group
                    regularly sends things to be published, you each receive 1g per day and many expenses can be
                    reimbursed.
                    The most popular papers are the Korranburg Chronicle and the Voice of Breland. If you wish, you may
                    start your own periodical as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Newspapers also frequently work with detective agencies, sharing information generally helping each
                    other out, unless something need to be kept
                    out of the public for a time first. Agents are typically hired on a as needed basis at rates from 5s
                    to 10s per day in addition to expenses. Many
                    are available for private contract work, with very few only offering their services to law
                    enforcement or the government. This is another organization
                    that can be founded by the party.

                <p>
                    Governmental agencies, commonly espionage or intelligence agencies, will occasionally look outside
                    their groups to
                    offer employment to those who seem talented in those fields. Your group typically gets access to an
                    account, limiting your
                    usage to 100g per member per month for day to day expenses in addition to the payment of the job
                    itself. It is allowed to
                    go over that limit, but you will be audited and may be required to pay the difference. If abuse of
                    this system is frequent,
                    you may be cut off from the account. Compared to other patrons, you have little say in declining
                    work from Agencies.
                    Possible ones to join are the Trust in Zilgaro and the Dark Lanterns in Breland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes a group may work directly for a ruler or governmental body, typically as a 'special
                    forces' of sorts. Working
                    directly for the heads of state tends to bring a great deal of authority to your encounters and some
                    actions may be overlooked.
                    Like with an agency, you have little say in your jobs, typically being on call for assignment. Due
                    to this you have a daily
                    salary of 1g, on the job or not, and you are reimbursed for most routine expenditures while on duty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Militaries are also an option. Your absolute obedience is expected, but you do receive up to 20%
                    discounts on equipment, and free
                    food and lodging in barracks or forts (of which there are many). Contracts are typically either six
                    months, one year, or two years at a time.
                    You also have a 1s per day salary, both on and off duty. Promotions bring in a larger pay check, of
                    course.

            <h3 class="text-center mb-3">Adventurer's Guilds</h3>
            <div class="info-block mb-5">
                <p>
                    Various guilds dot Khorvaire ranging in size from a dozen or so to upwards of 200. Guilds do not
                    directly hire out
                    services, but act as a gathering place for adventurers to meet and share information. Those looking
                    to hire will typically
                    bring their job to a guild master who then lets whoever wants sign up for job, only sometimes
                    directly choosing a group,
                    depending on the situation.Most guilds require sponsorship to join, which usually just involves an
                    okay from several members
                    after a display of ability, fame can circumvent this, depending on need. Since they do not take a
                    cut of a job's pay, membership requires a yearly dues.
                    Membership offers services
                    in addition to jobs such as lodging and storage at a lower rate, but similar quality, to commercial
                    versions. Membership often
                    times brings discounts from local shops as well. Most guilds are allied with each other, enabling
                    benefits even if not a direct
                    member, but bitter rivalries also exist between certain guilds. The most famous and largest guilds
                    are the Clifftop Adventurer's
                    Guild and Deathsgate Explorer's Club in Sharn and the Wayfinder's Guild in Fairhaven.

                    Those with arcane and divine aptitude may find themselves entering deals with magical entities on
                    their adventures. Sometimes this
                    may manifest in a Patron as with a Warlock, but can also form as a more mundane arrangement. Tasks
                    assigned by these forces tend to
                    revolve around finding lost magical items, protecting areas, and sometimes eliminating a certain
                    threat. Jobs are typically not paid,
                    but these adventures will often have great shares of treasures to be found. Depending on the patron
                    themselves, they may also reward
                    in additional treasures, secrets, or even magical abilities. Patrons under this category include the
                    Lords of Dust, The Chamber, Sora

                    businesses to survive against the monopolies of the great Houses. Although exclusive, membership
                    ranges from most economical and cultural
                    backgrounds, primarily focusing on how much potential an individual has. Members range from farmers,
                    to businessmen and from crime lords
                    to union representatives. There are even a few ex-House members in its fold today. Overall the Aurum
                    is known for much of the charity work
                    throughout the continent, actually being one of the biggest forces behind the increase in public
                    education. While mostly benevolent, there
                    are many conspiracy theories involving plans to usurp the governments and destroy the Houses for
                    good. This may have some credence due to
                    Aurum's seeming unity during the war, with many divisions only forming during peacetime. Members
                    have a tendency towards collecting rare
                    works throughout the world, sometimes putting them at odds with universities for procurement of
                    these artifacts. Others may look for
                    evidence of wrongdoings by the Houses. Membership may be a ways off for an aspiring group of
                    adventurers, but in the meantime, there are
                    loads of business opportunities for those who keep an eye out.

                <p>
                    The Dragons of Argonnessen have not been seen in over a millennium, cloistering themselves away to
                    study the Dragon Prophecy. While many
                    people know this, few know what this truly means. The Prophecy is able to predict nearly every event
                    that has happened and will happen.
                    This are interpreted through the stars, weather patterns and other divining methods and compared to
                    strange carved monoliths that have
                    existed since the dawn of time. The Chamber decide which course of actions are the best and try to
                    prevent or ensure certain outcomes.
                    While this is not common knowledge by any means, it seems to remain as a very popular conspiracy
                    theory involving the Dragons secretly
                    ruling the world. Chances are you may be hired by emissaries of The Chamber without ever knowing it
                    or the consequences of your quest.

                <p>
                    Similarly to The Chamber, the Lords of Dust also interpret the Dragon Prophecy to their own agenda.
                    Theirs however are leading to the
                    freedom of their demonic Overlords, imprisoned by the Dragons and Couatl so long ago. The agents are
                    mostly Rakshasa, a type of
                    shapeshifting demon known for their dangerous cunning. Many conspiracy theories revolve around dark
                    cabal as well. Most of these are
                    in the form of being the secret power behind many of Eberron's affluent organizations. The Lords
                    also prefer to act in the background,
                    sometimes employing intrepid heros to do their dark bidding with the party being none the wiser.

            <div class="info-block mb-5">
                <p>
                    Long, long ago, the dream realm of Dal Quor was a peaceful place for the creatures of Eberron on
                    beyond to visit while they sleep. The
                    plane was attended to by dream spirits, who where overtaken by their nightmarish counterparts, the
                    Quori. Towards the end of the Giant's
                    civilization, the Quori mounted a massive attack on Eberron, decimating Sarlona in particular. After
                    not faring well for some time, the
                    Giants destroyed the moon corresponding with the plane, cutting off the physical link to Eberron and
                    banishing much of the Quori forces
                    back to their own realm. This destruction permanently cut off Dal Quor through all methods, but
                    dreaming and seems to have made dreamers
                    safe while there as well. Some Quori managed to stay on Eberron through bonding with hosts, or by
                    being in Kyber at the time, from which
                    can no longer escape. The Dreaming Dark is the ruling class of Quori that are intent on finding a
                    new way back to Eberron to finish their
                    conquest. So far, only the practitioners of the Path of Light see them as a threat and are the only
                    ones attempting to fix the dream
                    plan's corruption.

                    After the Mourning left Cyre uninhabited, many Warforged made way to the capitol, Metrol for unknown
                    purposes. After questioning the few
                    who returned, and from the couple of expeditions sent there, it was determined that a particular
                    Warforged calling himself the Lord of Blades
                    has been beckoning his brethren through the Mournlands, which strangely does not seem to affect
                    them. The Warforged who have returned have
                    extremely fuzzy memories of the events that lead to them meeting the Lord and during the return, but
                    vaguely recall the desire to forge a new
                    nation within the Mournlands. Due to its extreme danger, the nations have been forced to abandon
                    intelligence campaigns to Metrol.

            <div class="info-block mb-5">
                <p>
                    Named after the father of the supposed founder of The Blood of Vol, The Emerald Claw is known to be
                    a small, but extremely dangerous terrorist organization.
                    Unlike other members of the
                    religion, most members of the Claw seek to become undead such as liches or vampires. Their goal
                    seems to be to make the world a paradise for the
                    undead and the eventual extermination of life itself, so far this is only hindered by their relative
                    lack of numbers. Despite leading a somewhat
                    successful assault on Sharn, today the order is mostly known for deaths and kidnappings on the
                    fringes of society.
