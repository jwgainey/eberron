        <h2>The Houses</h2>
        <p>Several millenia ago, people started developing a natural affinity towards certain types of magic. These affinities
            were accompanied by an arcane birthmark wich came to be known as dragonmarks, originally believed to be gifts from the 
            Proginator Wyrms. As people discovered others with like marks, they banded together in clans in order to preserve their 
            abilities. While at first these clans were simply for protection, it soon became clear that these marks gave a certain
            edge in rather mundane or routine tasks over those without. The clans quickly became the go-to for getting jobs done 
            quickly and over time comepletly cornered their respective markets. While modern laws have prevented the Houses from 
            achieving a true monopoly or political power, this has done little to prevent the Houses from becoming a world power in 
            their own right. Those without marks, but appropriate apptitudes are able to join Houses, although their lack of a mark 
            tends to limit their upward mobility. When someone with a dragonmark joins or is born into the House, they take the name 
            of that House in addition to their own family name, the Barons tend to only be refered to by their House name. If someone 
            in the House is born without a mark, they still retain the name, in the likelyhood that the mark is simply missing a generation.
            In the event that the mark is no longer present in a family, they may still remain in the House, although they will most 
            likely loose the House name untill the mark enters the family once again. Marriage between Houses is forbidden, both as a taboo, 
            and by law, as the mixed heritages nearly always result in the ever unpredictable aberrant marks. These strange marks also
            show up from time to time in any populace seemingly at random. They tend to have destructive ablilites and attempts in the past
            have been made to eradicate them completly from the world. There are rumors of a secret House that deals in illegal business
            that shelters those with such a mark. If someone is excommunicated from a House it may result in suppression of their mark.
            This often involved a ritual flensing of the mark, if not outright amputation of the limb. This is considered a barbaric practice
            and today is only performed under the most extreme of circumstances.
        </p>

        <h2>House Medani</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Half-Elf</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Wroat, Breland</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Detection</li>
                <li>Speciality: Investigation</li>
                <li>Symbol: Basilisk coiled around an eye.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This young house is notable for working almost exclusively within Breland. With the mark of Detection, the dragonmarked can easily 
            see attributes that elude others using only mundane methods. They have been in service to the family of Breland acting as a sort of
            preventative security, often locating problems far before they actually happen. Recently some other nobles have hired out their services
            and the bulk of the House often hires out themselves as private investigators. Being amongst the newest of the Houses, they are not 
            nearly as profit minded as some of the more established ones, often forgoing pay when working with poorer clients. They also have 
            encroached on Houses Tharashk and Deneith's fields, but also being one of the smallest Houses, this is typically overlooked. While most 
            dragonmarks are only able to manefest in certain races, the mark of Detection is odd in that it seems to show up more often Half-Elves with
            direct Human or Elven parentage rather than Half-Elf ancestry, likewise, quarter-humans and elves seem to show the mark as well. 
        </p><br>

        <h2> House Tharashk</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Human and Half-Orc</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Zarash'ak, Shadow Marches</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Finding</li>
                <li>Speciality: Accuisitions</li>
                <li>Symbol: A flying dragonne.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The youngest of the Houses and the only one to have two races able to manefest the mark. Being the newest, they have not had time to hold 
            traditions that other Houses have held such as naming conventions or not going out bounds in terms of industry. They earned some ire from 
            House Deneith by succsessfully hiring members of the monstrous races in Droaam as workers or mercaneries, something Deneith was never able 
            to accomplish. They also intruded on mining, something House Kundarak had indirect control over. Due to their abilities they have also gone 
            into private investigations, although neither House Medani or Tharashk seem to mind sharing this. Work in the House is also much less 
            centralized than the other Houses, acting more similarly to a guild than an actual company. 
        </p>

        <h2>House Vadalis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Human</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Foalswood, Eldeen Reaches</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Handling</li>
                <li>Speciality: Animal Rearing</li>
                <li>Symbol: A Hippogriff weilding a spear.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>The smallest of the Houses by far, Vadalis consitsts of only a couple of families and their employees. The House specializes in 
            breeding magical creatures, rearing livestock, and occasionally hunting monsters plagueing the countryside. The members seem mostly
            content with what they have, rarely paying heed to the other Houses and sometimes shirking responibilies reguarding duties to the 
            Twelve, an organization consisting of representatives of the Houses. Even with a reputation clearer than most Houses, they are not immune
            to the odd rumors of experimenting with forces beyond their control. A common urban legend involves Vadalis engineering the very monsters
            they hunt or even specially magebreeding people. 
        </p><br>

        <h2>House Jorasco</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Halfling</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Vedykar, Karrnath</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Healing</li>
                <li>Speciality: Medicine</li>
                <li>Symbol: A griffin wearing a wreath.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>House Jorasco is one of the more devisive Houses. While they do operate their own fairly expensive clinics, they are also the ones to 
            operate medical schools across the continent. Even if a Jorosco House of Healing is not located in your town, it can almost be assured 
            that the local physician was trained by them. They are known for offering mundane healing as a reasonable price, but tends towards premium
            pricing for much quicker magical healing. Due to laws between Houses, they are unable to loan money for these services as they have in the 
            past, but they will accept favors in lieu of gold payment. It should be noted that they adopted this policy shortly after a marriage between 
            an heiress and the Bromir Clan, a family rumored to have ties in illicit trade.
        </p><br>

        <h2>House Ghallanda</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Halfling</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Gatherhold, Talentia Plains</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Hospitality</li>
                <li>Speciality: Food and shelter</li>
                <li>Symbol: A stylized blink dog.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This House runs the famed Golden Dragon Inn chain of taverns seen across Khorvaire and even beyond. These Inns are widely known for having
            the same level of quality across the board and for being avaliable at a modest price. There is an Inn in nearly every major city, most towns,
            and in a few remote villages alongside many roadside locations inbetween. Beyond the Golden Dragon, House Gallanda has set the standard for 
            food and hospitality quality, serving as a sort of FDA system in Khorvaire. Many independant restaraunts, clubs, and inns proudly display the 
            Blink Dog Mark, showing that they are of a similar quality. Those that do not are largely considered subpar in comparison. Along with House Jorasco,
            Ghallanda has significanly improved the lives of Khorvarians by eradicating once common diseases through their strict measuring guidlines. Dispite 
            their prominance and financial gains, they are not seen as important by some of the other Houses, forcing Ghallanda to get ahead in House politices
            using guild and charisma. 
        </p><br>

        <h2>House Cannith</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Human</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Sharn, Breland Korth, Karrnath Fairhaven, Aundair</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Making</li>
                <li>Speciality: Manufacture</li>
                <li>Symbol: A mechanical gorgon.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Possibly the most notorious of the Houses Cannith stands out for both making an ungodly fortune during the Last War and for being largely 
            responsible for most of technology in use today. Nearly every single magical item in use today has had Cannith hands in the development of it.
            They are also the most involved in the affairs of other Houses, such as building the Lighting Rail, under the perview of House Orien, or 
            developing airships for House Lyrandar. They are also responsible for the creation of the Warforged during the War by their mysterious creation
            forges. Currently split into three branches after a schism revolving around the next successor, the House is still among the most prominent of the 
            Houses, gaining a separate representative on the Twelves Council for each branch. Many other Houses see this a clear power move, although the bickering
            between the branches has put this mostly to rest. 
        </p><br>

        <h2>House Orien</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Human</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Passage, Aundair</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Passage</li>
                <li>Speciality: Transportation</li>
                <li>Symbol: A silver unicorn emblem.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>The Lighting Rail is Orien's claim to fame. This specialized train system revolutionized transport in Khorvaire, if not the world. Even with House 
                Lyrandar's airships encroaching on their field, House Orien remains dominate in terms of land transportation. Using their networks of roadways and 
                mundane train systems, Orien's abilies as a courier service are unsurmounted. Before the Mourning, their railways connected the entirety of Khorvaire
                with each other. Since then however, they have had difficulty connecting the two halves of the continent together, mostly operating under two distict 
                systems. It is their hope that they can reconnect the two halves, perhaps even through the Mournlands itself.
            </p><br>
        
        <h2>House Sivis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Gnome</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Korranberg, Zilargo</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Scribing</li>
                <li>Speciality: Communications</li>
                <li>Symbol: A cockatrice holding a candle and quill.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The Zil-based House is another widespread one being located in nearly every city and town in some capacity. With abilities based on diciphering, sending, 
            and translation, many of the the royal courts employ at least one Sivis member, if not more. Most major organizations also directly employ Sivis scribes, 
            but there are also many offices dedicated to their work across the land. Their work covers not only sending messaged to other stations, but can also cover 
            legal documentation, translating services, clerical work, jsut about anything that requires copious amounts of data or paperwork. They are close allies with
            House Orien, essetially forming a postal service, and with House Kundrak, regarding bank notes, loans and the like. Due to its wide  and amount of rather mundane 
            work, Sivis has one of the highest non-marked employment rates and , perhaps only surpassed by Cannith, because of their production needs. Sivis is also known
            for having stong rivalries in between the different families, much like most groups in Zilgaro in general. So far this has not had any major disruptions within 
            the House as a whole beyond reletively short teners of the actual leading family. 
        </p><br>

        <h2>House Deneith</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Human</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Karrlakton, Karrnath</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Sentinel</li>
                <li>Speciality: Mercenary/Bodyguarding</li>
                <li>Symbol: A head of a chimera on a sheild.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The House that dominates the mercenary trade, House Deneith successfully managed to remain true neutrality during the beginnings of the Last War. Traditionally, they 
            were hired out as private armies or guard for individuals, but had a special contract with the emporer of Galifar to act as an elite guard. When the war started, Deneith 
            refused to fight on behalf of each power, only allowing contracts for personal protection untill Karrnath broke centuries long code and demanded that they fight along side 
            their armies. Deciding to maintain neutrality, Deneith hired out to each country and actually manipulated some battles as they refused to fight other members of their own house. 
            Due to the spread thin forces, this is one of the major contributors to Karrnath developing their advanced undead legions. During the peacetime, Deneith resumed their mostly 
            security contracts and have officially denounce their use in the case of another civil war. They are also frequently employed by law enforcement to do the actual legwork in regard
            to searching for and capturing criminals. They hold no actual legal power in these situations, acting closer to full-time bounty hunters. They currently have a rivalry with House 
            Tharashk, due to the latter's success in contracting the monsterkin of Droaam. 
        </p><br>

        <h2>Houses Phiarlan and Thuranni</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Elven</li>
                <li>Headquarters: No central HQ, Regalport, Lhazaar Principalities</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Shadow</li>
                <li>Speciality: Entertainment</li>
                <li>Symbol: A five-headed hydra and a Nordic-styled Displacer Beast</li>
            </ul>

        <p>The oldest of the surviving Houses, House Phirlan split in two after a scism during the Last War, some members House Phiarlan broke off to found House Thuranni. 
            Both houses have hold over the arts and entertainment sector. They more directly
            operate theaters, galleries, studios, and organize various art guilds. Because of entertainers' abilities to gain admittance just about anywhere, the top members are also hired by
            nobles or wealthy merchants as spies or even in some cases, assassins. House Phiarlan has dedicated more time in their artistic ventures after the scism, after Thuranni left for the 
            mostly lawless Principalities and gaining a stronger reputation for their more dubious persuits. Some people belive that this scism was completely constructed to aliviate nasty rumors
            about House Phiarlan so that they may be able to operate more comfortably in the open.
        </p><br>

        <h2>House Lyrandar</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Half-Elf</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Stormhome</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Storm</li>
                <li>Speciality: Transport/ Weather Manipulation</li>
                <li>Symbol: A Kraken.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Due to their aid to Aundair during the War, this House was gifted the island of Stormhome off the coast. Normally shrouded in sever thunderstorms year-round, the House weathercrafters manipulated 
            a large part of the island to have pleasant, balmy weather instead, leading to the premire resort in Khorvaire. Through their weather-related abilities, the House was able to dominate trade across
            seas and after developing airships with House Cannith, the skys as well. In retaliation of having their market encroache on, House Orien developed the Lightning Rail, as well as other land-based vehicles
            to regain some of their lost profits. Having the newest of the dragonmarks, little is understood of how exactly their marks are able to operate on a grander scale compared to many others, and some 
            researchers believe these abilites may have unforseen concequences on the envirment at large.
        </p><br>

        <h2>House Kundarak</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Dwarven</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Korunda Gate, Mror Holds</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Warding</li>
                <li>Speciality: Banking/Security</li>
                <li>Symbol: A manticore with a crown and halibard.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The richest of the Houses, House Kundrak completly dominates the banking industry. Throughout Khorvaire, even the few remaining independant banks deal with Kundarak to some degree.
            Much of their hold come from indirect ownership of the many mines in the Mror Holds, although House Tharashk is starting to show a greater threat in this field due to their ability 
            to easily locate dragonshards wich fuels many of todays needs more than ordinary gems and metal ever could. Despite this threat, Kundarak still holds the majority of power regarding 
            finances and have recently started working with Houses Deneith and Cannith in operating prisons, high security detail, and personal security equipment for the masses. Due to their 
            location in the Holds, this House is rarely dealt with directly, often the only contact being through representatives sent to oversee international procedures or on the Twelve. This 
            is also the only House to have 100% of known individuals with the mark, either hiring them or essentially paying them to do anything not related in their field. Despite the relative 
            seclusion, there have been rumors floating around about a possible alliance of sorts with the Gatekeeper Druids, possibly because of their similar magical focus.
        </p><br>

        <h2>House Vol</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Elven</li>
                <li>Headquarters: None</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Death</li>
                <li>Speciality: Funeral rites.</li>
                <li>Symbol: An upside-down pheonix.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>An extint House from Arenal, much of its information has been lost to time. It is currently believed that the House was erradicated during an acient war between the elves and dragons, 
            after an impromptu alliance between them to take down the House. Why this was nessesary for a House specializing in funerary practices is currently unknown. It is also believed that the 
            last member of House Vol was the one who founded the religion of The Blood of Vol, wich is widely known for its rather liberal views on the undead. And if the sect the Order of the Emerald
            Claw is to be believed, Erandis Vol herself is somehow still alive and orchestrating acts of terror across the world. 
        </p><br>

        <h2>House Tarkanan</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Any</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Unknown</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: Aberrant</li>
                <li>Speciality: Destruction</li>
                <li>Symbol: A grinning beholder.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>After a strange spike in appearances of abberant dragonmarks, the Houses worked together to wipe them clean from the world. These marks have unpredictable, but often highly destructive 
            capabilities that frequently throws back much of the Houses' hard work over the centuries. During this War of the Mark, it was believed that all individuals bearing the mark was erradicated,
            but such a clain is rather substantial, esspecially considering an aberrant mark is not limited to races or bloodlines. There are rumors of an unoffical House that houses survivors of the war 
            and those with marks who are shunned or outcast, biding their time until they are able to enact revenge on the Houses.
        </p><br>

        <h2>The Twelve</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Any</li>
                <li>Headquarters: Currently within Karrnath</li>
                <li>Dragonmark: All</li>
                <li>Speciality: Magical Pursuit</li>
                <li>Symbol: A silhouette of a floating tower.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This organization of members of all the Houses (barring Thuranni and Tarkanan), and each of Cannith's branches, acts as both a watchdog of sorts and as a collaborative space between the Houses.
            The council makes sure that each House follows the edicts set in place so that one does not gain too much power over the others. Because of both Cannith and Phiarlan's scisms, this job has been 
            much easier to maintain in recent years. The headquarters is a massive floating and moving tower that houses various arcane and artifing labs. The Twelve hires interdisplinary magewrights, 
            technitians and scientists that the Houses are unable to individually. Representatives from the governments have semi-regular meetings with the Twelve to resolve disputes that come up from time 
            to time. The Twelve are also known for hiring contract work outside the group far more often than the Houses, to maintain a neutral standing.
