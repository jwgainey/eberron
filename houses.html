            <h2 class="text-center mb-3">The Houses</h2>
            <div class="info-block p-3">
                <p>
                    Several millennia ago, people started developing a natural affinity towards certain types of magic. These affinities
                    were accompanied by an arcane birthmark which came to be known as dragonmarks, originally believed to be gifts from the 
                    Progenitor Wyrms. As people discovered others with like marks, they banded together in clans in order to preserve their 
                    abilities. While at first these clans were simply for protection, it soon became clear that these marks gave a certain
                    edge in rather mundane or routine tasks over those without. The clans quickly became the go-to for getting jobs done 
                    quickly and over time completely cornered their respective markets. While modern laws have prevented the Houses from 
                    achieving a true monopoly or political power, this has done little to prevent the Houses from becoming a world power in 
                    their own right. Those without marks, but appropriate aptitudes are able to join Houses, although their lack of a mark 
                    tends to limit their upward mobility. When someone with a dragonmark joins or is born into the House, they take the name 
                    of that House in addition to their own family name, the Barons tend to only be refereed to by their House name. If someone 
                    in the House is born without a mark, they still retain the name, in the likelihood that the mark is simply skipping a generation.
                    In the event that the mark is no longer present in a family, they may still remain in the House, although they will most 
                    likely loose the House name until the mark enters the family once again. Marriage between Houses is forbidden, both as a taboo, 
                    and by law, as the mixed heritages nearly always result in the ever unpredictable aberrant marks. These strange marks also
                    show up from time to time in any populace seemingly at random. They tend to have destructive abilities and attempts in the past
                    have been made to eradicate them completely from the world. There are rumors of a secret House that deals in illegal business
                    that shelters those with such a mark. If someone is excommunicated from a House it may result in suppression of their mark.
                    This often involved a ritual flensing of the mark, if not outright amputation of the limb. This is considered a barbaric practice
                    and today is only performed under the most extreme of circumstances.

                                    This young house is notable for working almost exclusively within Breland. With the mark of Detection, the dragonmarked can easily 
                                    see attributes that elude others using only mundane methods. They have been in service to the family of Breland acting as a sort of
                                    preventative security, often locating problems far before they actually happen. Recently some other nobles have hired out their services
                                    and the bulk of the House often hires out themselves as private investigators. Being amongst the newest of the Houses, they are not 
                                    nearly as profit minded as some of the more established ones, often forgoing pay when working with poorer clients. They also have 
                                    encroached on Houses Tharashk and Deneith's fields, but also being one of the smallest Houses, this is typically overlooked. While most 
                                    dragonmarks are only able to manifest in certain races, the mark of Detection is odd in that it seems to show up more often Half-Elves with
                                    direct Human or Elven parentage and quarter-humans and quarter-elves seem to show the mark as well.

                                    The youngest of the Houses and the only one to have two races able to manifest the mark. Being the newest, they have not had time to hold 
                                    traditions that other Houses have held such as naming conventions or not going out bounds in terms of industry. They earned some ire from 
                                    House Deneith by successfully hiring members of the monstrous races in Droaam as workers or mercenaries, something Deneith was never able 
                                    to accomplish. They also intruded on mining, something House Kundarak had indirect control over. Due to their abilities they have also gone 
                                    into private investigations, although neither House Medani or Tharashk seem to mind sharing this. Work in the House is also much less 
                                    centralized than the other Houses, acting more similarly to a guild than an actual company.

                                    The smallest of the Houses by far, Vadalis consists of only a couple of families and their employees. The House specializes in 
                                    breeding magical creatures, rearing livestock, and occasionally hunting monsters plaguing the countryside. The members seem mostly
                                    content with what they have, rarely paying heed to the other Houses and sometimes shirking responsibilities regarding duties to the 
                                    Twelve, an organization consisting of representatives of the Houses. Even with a reputation clearer than most Houses, they are not immune
                                    to the odd rumors of experimenting with forces beyond their control. A common urban legend involves Vadalis engineering the very monsters
                                    they hunt or even specially magebreeding people.

                                    House Jorasco is one of the more divisive Houses. While they do operate their own fairly expensive clinics, they are also the ones to 
                                    operate medical schools across the continent. Even if a Jorosco House of Healing is not located in your town, it can almost be assured 
                                    that the local physician was trained by them. They are known for offering mundane healing as a reasonable price, but tends towards premium
                                    pricing for much quicker magical healing. Due to laws between Houses, they are unable to loan money for these services as they have in the 
                                    past, but they will accept favors in lieu of gold payment. It should be noted that they adopted this policy shortly after a marriage between 
                                    an heiress and the Bromir Clan, a family rumored to have ties in illicit trade.

                                    Possibly the most notorious of the Houses Cannith stands out for both making an ungodly fortune during the Last War and for being largely 
                                    responsible for most of technology in use today. Nearly every single magical item in use today has had Cannith hands in the development of it.
                                    They are also the most involved in the affairs of other Houses, such as building the Lighting Rail, under the purview of House Orien, or 
                                    developing airships for House Lyrandar. They are also responsible for the creation of the Warforged during the War by their mysterious creation
                                    forges. Currently split into three branches after a schism revolving around the next successor, the House is still among the most prominent of the 
                                    Houses, gaining a separate representative on the Twelves Council for each branch. Many other Houses see this a clear power move, although the bickering
                                    between the branches has put this mostly to rest.

                                    The Lighting Rail is Orien's claim to fame. This specialized train system revolutionized transport in Khorvaire, if not the world. Even with House 
                                    Lyrandar's airships encroaching on their field, House Orien remains dominate in terms of land transportation. Using their networks of roadways and 
                                    mundane train systems, Orien's abilities as a courier service are unmatched. Before the Mourning, their railways connected the entirety of Khorvaire
                                    with each other. Since then however, they have had difficulty connecting the two halves of the continent together, mostly operating under two distinct 
                                    systems. It is their hope that they can reconnect the two halves, perhaps even through the Mournlands itself.

                                    The Zil-based House is another widespread one being located in nearly every city and town in some capacity. With abilities based on deciphering, sending, 
                                    and translation, many of the the royal courts employ at least one Sivis member, if not more. Most major organizations also directly employ Sivis scribes, 
                                    but there are also many offices dedicated to their work across the land. Their work covers not only sending messaged to other stations, but can also cover 
                                    legal documentation, translating services, clerical work, just about anything that requires copious amounts of data or paperwork. They are close allies with
                                    House Orien, essentially forming a postal service, and with House Kundrak, regarding bank notes, loans and the like. Due to its wide  and amount of rather mundane 
                                    work, Sivis has one of the highest non-marked employment rates and , perhaps only surpassed by Cannith, because of their production needs. Sivis is also known
                                    for having strong rivalries in between the different families, much like most groups in Zilgaro in general. So far this has not had any major disruptions within 
                                    the House as a whole beyond relatively short tenure of the actual leading family.

                                    The House that dominates the mercenary trade, House Deneith successfully managed to remain true neutrality during the beginnings of the Last War. Traditionally, they 
                                    were hired out as private armies or guard for individuals, but had a special contract with the Emperor of Galifar to act as an elite guard. When the war started, Deneith 
                                    refused to fight on behalf of each power, only allowing contracts for personal protection until Karrnath broke centuries long code and demanded that they fight along side 
                                    their armies. Deciding to maintain neutrality, Deneith hired out to each country and actually manipulated some battles as they refused to fight other members of their own house. 
                                    Due to the spread thin forces, this is one of the major contributors to Karrnath developing their advanced undead legions. During the peacetime, Deneith resumed their mostly 
                                    security contracts and have officially denounce their use in the case of another civil war. They are also frequently employed by law enforcement to do the actual legwork in regard
                                    to searching for and capturing criminals. They hold no actual legal power in these situations, acting closer to full-time bounty hunters. They currently have a rivalry with House 
                                    Tharashk, due to the latter's success in contracting the monsterkin of Droaam.

                                    The oldest of the surviving Houses, House Phirlan split in two after a scsim during the Last War, some members House Phiarlan broke off to found House Thuranni. 
                                    Both houses have hold over the arts and entertainment sector. They more directly
                                    operate theaters, galleries, studios, and organize various art guilds. Because of entertainers' abilities to gain admittance just about anywhere, the top members are also hired by
                                    nobles or wealthy merchants as spies or even in some cases, assassins. House Phiarlan has dedicated more time in their artistic ventures after the scism, after Thuranni left for the 
                                    mostly lawless Principalities and gaining a stronger reputation for their more dubious persuits. Some people belive that this scism was completely constructed to aliviate nasty rumors
                                    about House Phiarlan so that they may be able to operate more comfortably in the open.

                                    Due to their aid to Aundair during the War, this House was gifted the island of Stormhome off the coast. Normally shrouded in sever thunderstorms year-round, the House weathercrafters manipulated 
                                    a large part of the island to have pleasant, balmy weather instead, leading to the premier resort in Khorvaire. Through their weather-related abilities, the House was able to dominate trade across
                                    seas and after developing airships with House Cannith, the skys as well. In retaliation of having their market encroached on, House Orien developed the Lightning Rail, as well as other land-based vehicles
                                    to regain some of their lost profits. Having the newest of the dragonmarks, little is understood of how exactly their marks are able to operate on a grander scale compared to many others, and some 
                                    researchers believe these abilities may have unforeseen consequences on the environment at large.

                                    The richest of the Houses, House Kundrak completely dominates the banking industry. Throughout Khorvaire, even the few remaining independent banks deal with Kundarak to some degree.
                                    Much of their hold come from indirect ownership of the many mines in the Mror Holds, although House Tharashk is starting to show a greater threat in this field due to their ability 
                                    to easily locate dragonshards which fuels many of todays needs more than ordinary gems and metal ever could. Despite this threat, Kundarak still holds the majority of power regarding 
                                    finances and have recently started working with Houses Deneith and Cannith in operating prisons, high security detail, and personal security equipment for the masses. Due to their 
                                    location in the Holds, this House is rarely dealt with directly, often the only contact being through representatives sent to oversee international procedures or on the Twelve. This 
                                    is also the only House to have 100% of known individuals with the mark, either hiring them or essentially paying them to do anything not related in their field. Despite the relative 
                                    seclusion, there have been rumors floating around about a possible alliance of sorts with the Gatekeeper Druids, possibly because of their similar magical focus.

                                    An extinct House from Arenal, much of its information has been lost to time. It is currently believed that the House was eradicated during an ancient war between the elves and dragons, 
                                    after an impromptu alliance between them to take down the House. Why this was necessary for a House specializing in funerary practices is currently unknown. It is also believed that the 
                                    last member of House Vol was the one who founded the religion of The Blood of Vol, which is widely known for its rather liberal views on the undead. And if the sect the Order of the Emerald
                                    Claw is to be believed, Erandis Vol herself is somehow still alive and orchestrating acts of terror across the world.

                                    After a strange spike in appearances of aberrant dragonmarks, the Houses worked together to wipe them clean from the world. These marks have unpredictable, but often highly destructive 
                                    capabilities that frequently throws back much of the Houses' hard work over the centuries. During this War of the Mark, it was believed that all individuals bearing the mark was eradicated,
                                    but such a clain is rather substantial, especially considering an aberrant mark is not limited to races or bloodlines. There are rumors of an unofficial House that houses survivors of the war 
                                    and those with marks who are shunned or outcast, biding their time until they are able to enact revenge on the Houses.

                                    This organization of members of all the Houses (barring Thuranni and Tarkanan), and each of Cannith's branches, acts as both a watchdog of sorts and as a collaborative space between the Houses.
                                    The council makes sure that each House follows the edicts set in place so that one does not gain too much power over the others. Because of both Cannith and Phiarlan's schisms, this job has been 
                                    much easier to maintain in recent years. The headquarters is a massive floating and moving tower that houses various arcane and artificing labs. The Twelve hires interdisciplinary magewrights, 
                                    technicians and scientists that the Houses are unable to individually. Representatives from the governments have semi-regular meetings with the Twelve to resolve disputes that come up from time 
                                    to time. The Twelve are also known for hiring contract work outside the group far more often than the Houses, to maintain a neutral standing.
