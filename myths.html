                    Due to its rather tumultuous history, the world of Eberron is shrouded in mystery. Empires has risen
                    and fallen.
                    Species gained and lost dominance, and many near planet-wide disasters have taken place. Despite all
                    this, some information
                    from various eras have stayed through the civilizations in the form of stories and myths, which in
                    turn has lead to some
                    taking the form of religions. Religions function a bit differently in Eberron than in other
                    settings. While gods have a
                    indisputable physical presence in other settings, it is much more ambiguous here. The gods have
                    rarely,if ever shown up
                    in the physical plane, and their very existence is called into question by skeptics. This being
                    said, divine casters are
                    a bit rarer than in other settings as well. Also as a result churches tend to be a place of guidance
                    rather than healing,
                    which is mostly left to House Jorasco. Some exceptions take place of course for members and friends
                    of the church in question.
                    This section foes into greater detail on each of the major religions, shared myths and other belief
                    systems in Eberron.

                <p>
                    The myth of the three dragons who created the known universe is well known across the entire world.
                    It states that the three Wyrms,
                    Siberys, Khyber and Eberron were siblings who worked together to create the planes that make up this
                    universe. When they got to the
                    material plane however, they began to disagree on how the world should function. This lead to the
                    killing of Siberys by Khyber, and in
                    retaliation for her brother's murder, Eberron imprisoned her sister within the coils of her own
                    body, creating the world of Eberron,
                    the extradimensional depths of Kyber and the ring of Siberys around the planet.

                </p>
                <p>
                    It is part of this myth that explains where life comes from as well. Siberys is believed to have
                    directly created angels and coatls, or
                    that his spilt blood gave birth to these creatures. Kyber is the source of devils and monsters, and
                    sometimes blame is given to her regarding
                    aberrations and denizens of Xoriat, although it is truly unknown where they came from. Like with her
                    brother, Eberron is credited with the birth
                    of the mortal races, either directly or from her blood. It is through the mixed blood of all three
                    that gave birth to the dragons. How these
                    individual races coexisted can be found in the <a href="history.html">world history</a> page.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, this is largely regarded as merely a legend and is not treated very seriously as a creation
                    theory. But throughout the ages, the myth did
                    retain some permeance and many things today are named after or are in reference to the Dragons. The
                    closest thing to a religion following them would
                    be those who look into the Dragon Prophecy, though besides the Dragons of Argossennen, these are
                    few.

                    The most widespread religion across Khorvaire, the Sovereign Host is a pantheon of gods who are
                    typically worshiped as a whole, but individuals will
                    follow one or two more closely due to their livelihoods. Worship also tends to be very personal and
                    in terms of the community, practical. For instance,
                    a town library might also serve as the temple to Aureon, the god of knowledge, while a particularly
                    well renowned smithy may also be a shrine to Onatar,
                    the god of creation. The clergy are typically trained in the history and rites of the religion along
                    side their trade. They are well versed of the pantheon
                    as a whole, but still have their focus in one appropriately in line with their profession.

                </p>
                <p>
                    It is commonly believed that the Host are in a sense all the old pantheons from various cultures,
                    essentially treating them as the same deities, just under
                    different names. In some faiths, particularly smaller monotheistic ones, they will use the Sovereign
                    name, or a localized version of it. For instance, Halflings
                    of the Talenta Plains tend to worship spirits under the leadership of a wilderness god known as
                    Ba-li, very similar to the god of the hunt, Balinor. Other
                    It is uncommon to believe that the Host actually created the world, but more likely that they
                    reshaped what was already there and brought a sense of civilization
                    to a chaotic realm. This aligns fairly well with the Progenitor myth, with one theory stating the
                    gods are simply aspects of the Dragons themselves.
                    The Dark Six are a related pantheon of related gods who were either cast out or abandoned by
                    their followers for their negative connotations. It is however still common to see charms made in
                    respect to the six to stave of their destructive effects,
                    but worship is incredibly rare.

                <p>
                    The afterlife is strangely not a large aspect of this religion. It is believed that all souls go to
                    the plane of Dolurrh after death, regardless of actions in
                    life. This belief places a strong emphasis on living a good life for its own sake, rather than for
                    rewards later on. It is an uncommon belief that the gods will
                    one day 'purify' Dolurrh to be a more pleasant afterlife, though this is seen as heresy by the
                    majority of followers. A more common belief is that the souls who
                    fade from Dolurrh ascend to a true afterlife with the gods, designating the plane as a sort of
                    purgatory.

                    A dark mirror to the Host, the Six represents destruction or the negative qualities in life. In
                    ancient times they were worshipped along
                    and actually a part of the Host, but were differentiated and lost followers over time. Today they
                    can still be seen in charms or smaller
                    shrines to at least pay reverence to them in an attempt to stave off their dominions. The only
                    exception is The Traveller, who typically
                    is not seen as evil like the rest, but seen as a troublemaker and is not commonly seen worshiped in
                    the open as a result.

                <p>
                    Little is known about the specific beliefs of sects of this religion due to its taboo nature. Droaam
                    is the only country with open worship
                    although it should be noted that there is a focus on the six's few positive qualities rather than
                    just their destructive nature. Outside
                    of worship, they are recognized by Vassals, but are only ever called upon to stave off their
                    effects. For instance, sailors commonly leave
                    offerings to the Devourer, if it is believed a storm will be on their route. Likewise, soldiers may
                    have a token of
                    the Fury in attempt to appease to her mercy.

                <p>
                    Out of the Six, worship of the Traveler seems to be the most accepted, although still rare. The
                    Traveler is known to be a mysterious entity,
                    as likely to give help as they are to sow misfortune. They are oftentimes credited with large leaps
                    in innovation, and as such, is becoming
                    more common to see some respect given in artificer's circles.
                    It should be noted that most of their symbols are simple wreaths or talismans made from their
                    desired material.

                <p>
                    While Critical Role's version of the Traveler is a lot of fun and has some similarities, they are
                    still quite different. On one hand, Artagan
                    can be selfish and inconsiderate, but ultimately fairly decent, if not good person who simply loves
                    pranks a bit too much. On the other, The
                    Traveler's ideas of a prank would be much more destructive to someone's wellbeing, behaving as they
                    see fit without the confines of morality.
                    A better archetype would be Loki from mythology, a constant troublemaker, although not quite evil or
                    good, with a few positive aspects if you can work
                    past the bad.

                    The other major religion in Khorvaire, this one is much more centralized with nearly uniform
                    churches dotting the continent.
                    It is notable in that its deity is a composite of several souls and an ancient purifying force
                    rather than an anthropomorphized concept.
                    The primary faith in Thrane, it had successfully spread to other countries before The Inquisition
                    took place, and spread nearly
                    halted completely during the Last War after the church took leadership of Thrane. That being said
                    the Purified gained before the
                    Last War tended to remain devout. Many churches, especially outside Thrane teach of forgiveness and
                    redemption more than the typical
                    dogma of eradicating evil. Most traditional teachings preach about vanquishing evil in the world,
                    leaving no quarter for the wicked.
                    Much of this comes from the origins of the faith, the figurehead being a column of literal flame
                    that speaks only to the pure of heart.
                    This flame marks the spot a Paladin named Tir Miron and her unnamed Coatl companion who sacrificed
                    their lives to seal away a Demon Lord
                    who was wrecking havoc across the land. The Flame is said to be the combined souls of Miron, the
                    coatl and the souls of the Purified
                    of the Flame. Even with the rarity of those with even the ability to resurrect the dead, those who
                    can that are of the faith do so very
                    sparingly. Between the belief in the gestalt of souls that is their afterlife and having a priority
                    on keeping the sanctity of the soul,
                    it is a very frowned upon practice, although some exceptions can be made under extraneous
                    circumstances.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As stated before, many members of the both the congregation and the clergy are adopting a more
                    progressive stance regarding their place in
                    the world. Followers of the Flame easily see a kinship with practitioners of the Host, although it
                    irks many clergy due to its much looser
                    structure. They also admire the similar goals of the Path of Light, despite mch ambiguity about that
                    particular religion. Despite the general
                    friendliness between these religions, the Purified tend to see themselves as 'correct'. They do not
                    appreciate any veneration of the Dark Six,
                    believe all practitioners of the Blood of Vol are evil, and are the only organization that takes the
                    Lords of Dust seriously anymore.
                    These beliefs can be exemplified in the subset known as the Flame Keepers. Originally part of the
                    elite and guard forces of the Silver Flame, some
                    of the more traditional minded clergy and military went against newer orders and continued to behave
                    in a zealous manner. Due to the repercussions of
                    the war, The Church has been unable to reign in these rogue forces, much to the chagrin of nearly
                    the entire continent. These forces do not subjugate
                    haphazardly, but have been reported to strong arm smaller communities under the prospect of
                    protection. To their credit, very little supernatural activity
                    has happened under their watch.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The leader of the Church is known as the Speaker of the Flame. When one reaches around the age of 20
                    or dies, a new one is chosen from a selection of children
                    who are able to interpret the word of the Flame. This selection is very careful due to the belief
                    that the Demon Lord that was sealed away is able to communicate
                    through the flames, so that only the pure of heart may be chosen for being unaffected. Unchosen are
                    typically kept as additional advisers or gain admittance to the
                    clergy. The current Speaker is Jaela Daren, the first in nearly a generation. The young Half-Orc was
                    chosen a bit older than is typical for the Speaker role, but with
                    a several decade absence of one, she was gladly put in place. It should be noted that the absence
                    was after the monarchy of Thrane was overthrown by the populace
                    towards the beginnings of the Last War. The royal family traditionally ruled alongside the church,
                    similar to medieval England, but they did not seem to hold
                    to the same tenants as the populace and lead very hedonistic lives. Being drug into a war did not
                    help their matters and the Church rose as the governing party for
                    Thrane. Unfortunately, by this time the war was in full swing and Thrane, like every other country
                    did what they had to do to survive.

                <p>
                    The Blood of Vol is a complicated religion to put it mildly. There are numerous misconceptions about
                    the religion as a whole and especially towards
                    the Seekers of the Divinity sect, both due to the actions of the Order of the Emerald Claw, and both
                    sects' views on life, death and undeath. Said to have
                    been founded by Erandis d'Vol of the extinct House Vol, this religion rejects the concept of death
                    and the afterlife in favor of each individual ascending through
                    their own spark of divinity. In this pursuit, some have performed deeds of questionable morality in
                    order to either expand their life or even achieve immortality.
                    It seems much of this plays from a fear of the nature of Dollurh, which practitioners believe is the
                    only true afterlife, and must be avoided at all costs. Due to its
                    sordid past, it is not typically practiced openly, except in Karrnath, but under more subtle
                    methods, most of the time under charity or other work that alleviates the pain that life gives
                    as it were. Seekers have a much more liberal view on the undead than most others typically would,
                    seeing the use of otherwise rotting husks as simply a resource to use.
                    It is also through their magic specialties that Karrnath was able to develop their slightly
                    intelligent undead legions, utilizing bodies, but without tainting the souls.
                    There are rumors of some higher ranking officials within Karrnath and the religion being intelligent
                    undead like vampires or mummies. Facts regarding this are unknown
                    at large, but it is commonly believed that this sort of undead corrupts the soul, and therefore
                    one's divinity, so it seems like an unlikely rumor at best.
                    The Order of the Emerald Claw however, seems to love using necromancy in all its forms. Claiming to
                    be under the orders of Erandis Vol herself, this sect seeks to remake the world into an
                    undead paradise. Largely considered a terrorist organization, this relatively new group has
                    orchestrated numerous attacks on settlements across Khorvaire. After a rather
                    destructive battle against Thranish templars, their numbers seem to have dwindled, but many fear
                    that they are simply biding their time and slowly rebuilding.

                    Not an actual religion, the cults are so named due to the common belief that their worship relates
                    to source of the world's evil, Kyhber. In actuality, very few, if any
                    worship the Dragon herself, with most followings being small sects under a Demon Lord whose bonds
                    are loosening, an abomination that has made contact with mortals, or in
                    some cases, a fledgling, but powerful fey or celestial being. It would be ignorant to state that all
                    who fall under this banner are evil, but due to some lingering
                    paranoia regarding the War and from sects of legitimate threats, most practice stays secret,
                    unfortunately compounding those fears.

                    This religion from the Kalashtar across the ocean is a bit different from other religions. They do
                    not worship or even recognize a god or higher power
                    or even follow a particular set of rules. This faith states that everyone and everything are
                    connected, even the good and evil in the world, and that
                    by improving yourself you can improve everything around you. One of the chief goals of the religion
                    is to purify Dal Quor from the nightmare spirits that
                    currently plague it. Since the Kalashtar can naturally tap into their own psionic abilities, they
                    have dedicated much of their time in meditation and
                    self-reflection to combat these psychic demons. After some immigration to Khorvaire, other groups
                    have taken on the faith as well, but as they require much,
                    much more training to even attempt the most basic of psionic abilities, many have focused on making
                    the world around them better more directly. Many individuals
                    dedicate their time to helping others through acts of charity and kindness. The Kalashtar
                    Enlightened seem to find this agreeable, seeing as anybody can find
                    or even create their own role to play.

                    One of the few religions where the object of worship is physically present, the Undying Court is a
                    bit odd, especially in relation to the faiths
                    Khorvaire. In Arenal, the Elves have mastered a form of necromancy that utilizes positive energy,
                    creating beings of light and life rather than darkness
                    and death. These spiritual beings are forged from the souls of those who perform great deeds in the
                    service of Arenal, otherwise they would typically
                    reincarnate. The Court typically gives advice and information to those who ask, but indirectly
                    rules, letting the still living Elves govern day to day matters.
                    Their religious aspect mostly comes into play because they can decide what happened to an Areni when
                    they die. If they performed valiantly, they are offered
                    a position on the Court, simply reincarnated, or in extreme circumstances, removed from the cycle
                    entirely as punishment. They have some similarities with the Silver
                    Flame in that they both seek to eradicate evil from the world and are often the first line of
                    defence against outside forces, although their use of undead has
                    earned the ire of the Church.

                <p>
                    Being direct decedents of the Tairnadal Elves, the Elves of Valenar also practice a form of ancestor
                    worship. Being of a different culture however, they do not follow
                    the Court, but rather their direct ancestors. Their tenets run along the lines of following in the
                    footsteps of a great hero, or questioning what past experts might
                    have done in relevant situations. This faith has also allowed non-elves to join, although higher
                    ranking individuals still run along family lines.
                    Drow of Arenal follow along with the Undying Court, but those who have been raised in Xen'Drik
                    follow a similar path to the Tairnadal, though from a less dogmatic perspective.
                    Many also do not believe in reincarnation as what just naturally happens, although some individuals
                    have come back for a purpose. Elves throughout the rest of Khorvaire tend
                    to follow the local religion like most other citizens, but tend to incorporate the concept of
                    reincarnation to them. The secular Elves that still believe in reincarnation
                    still show some respect to the Court despite the lack of worship, seeing them more as a collection
                    of ancestors than a true deity.

                </p>
                <p>
                    It is believed that the souls of non-elves that go to Dolurrh eventually fade away and reincarnate
                    at random, so far removed from their previous life that they are an entirely
                    new being. Sometimes this new life is an Elf and they will then be part of the normal Elven life
                    cycle. As mentioned under new options, an Elf can live to around 200 years and
                    when they die, they are quickly reincarnated into a new Elf for a few generations. After this, they
                    are either made into an undying, who later on may be put back in the cycle
                    'fresh' or invited into the court, 'restarted' as a new Elf, or rarely, cast off entirely into
                    Dolurrh. Reincarnates typically only have fuzzy memories of their previous lives
                    but are frequently stated by those who may have known both to have the same core personality traits.

                    Another faith that is not a religion in the strictest terms. All Druids venerate various natural
                    spirits, or sometimes fey beings, where they get their powers from.
                    But each group may favor certain spirits over others, or have a particular agenda in mind for their
                    duties. In Khorvaire, most Druids are in the farthest reaches of
                    the Shadow Marches, Q'barra, or the Eldeen Reaches and the oldest have Orcish or Goblin roots. Today
                    there are not too many Circles left with many people joining
                    civilization and industry, as of now, they do not seem to be in danger of dying out, but that day
                    may come sooner rather than later. It should also be noted that
                    while the title 'druid' is used for followers, this does not mean that one must be that class.
                    Others like paladins, sorcerers, warlocks, and even bards are fairly
                    common among the circles.
