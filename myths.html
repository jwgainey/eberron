        <h2>Myths and Religion</h2>
            <p>Due to its rather tumultuous history, the world of Eberron is shrouded in mystery. Empires has risen and fallen.
                Species gained and lost dominance, and near planetwide disasters have taken place. Despite all this, some information
                from various eras have stayed through the civilizations in the form of stories and myths, wich in turn has lead to some 
                taking the form of religions. Religions function a bit differently in Eberron than in other settings. While gods have a 
                indesputible physical presence in other settings, it is much more ambiguous here. The gods have rarely,if ever shown up
                in the physical plane, and their very existance is called into question by skeptics. This being said, divine casters are
                a bit rarer than in other settings as well. Also as a result churches tend to be a place of guidance rather than healing, 
                wich is mostly left to House Jorasco. Some exceptions take place of course for members and friends of the church in question.
                This section foes into greater detail on each of the major religions, shared myths and other belief systems in Eberron.
            </p><br>

        <h2>Proginator Dragons</h2>
            <p>The myth of the three dragons who created the known universe is well known across the entire world. It states that the three Wyrms,
                Siberys, Khyber and Eberron were siblings who worked together to create the planes that make up this universe. When they got to the 
            material plane however, they began to disagree on how the world should function. This lead to the killing of Siberys by Khyber, and in 
            retaliation for her brother's murder, Eberrron imprisoned her sister within the coils of her own body, creating the world of Eberron, 
            the extradimensional depths of Kyber and the ring of Siberys around the planet. 
        </p>
        <p>It is part of this myth that explains where life comes from as well. Siberys is believed to have directly created angels and coatls, or 
            that his spilt blood gave birth to these creatures. Kyber is the source of devils and monsters, and sometimes blame is given to her regarding
            abberations and denizens of Xoriat, although it is truely unkown where they came from. Like with her brother, Eberron is credited with the birth
            of the mortal races, either directly or from her blood. IT is through the mixed blood of all three that gave birth to the dragons. How these
            individual races coexisted can be found in the <a href="history.html">world history</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>Today, this is largely regarded as merely a legend and is not treated very seriously as a creation theory. But throughout the ages, the myth did
            retain some permiance and many things today are named after or are in reference to the Dragons. The closest thing to a religion following them would
            be those who look into the Dragon Prophecy, though besides the Dragons of Argossennen, these are few.

        <h2>The Sovereign Host</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Diety: Good-Aligned Pantheon</li>
                <li>Followers: Vassals</li>
                <li>Structure: Personal worship utilizing shrines in practical settings.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The most widespread religion across Khorvaire, the Sovereign Host is a pantheon of gods who are typically worshiped as a whole, but indiviuals will
            follow one or two more closely due to their livelyhoods. Worship also tends to be very personal and in terms of the community, practical. For instance,
            a town library might also serve as the temple to Aureon, the god of knowledge, while a particularly well renowned smithy may also be a shrine to Onatar,
            the god of creation. Because of this, dedicated temples are much rarer, especially in more rural areas, with the only 'true' temple to the nine being in 
            Sharn. Each god has their own dominion, with clerics essentially being a pious individual who follows a lifestyle suiting that particular god, rather than 
            someone who has spent time soley as a member of the clergy. The Dark Six are a related pantheon of related gods who were either cast out or abandonded by 
            their followers for their negative connotations. It is however still common to see charms made in respect to the six to stave of their destructive effects,
            but worship is incredibly rare.

        <h2>The Dark Six</h2>

                <li>Diety: Panthon of evil (and one chaotic) dieties</li>

                <li>Structure: Typically only revered or respected under certain circumstances.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>A dark mirror to the Host, the Six represents destruction or the negative qualities in life. In ancient times they were worshipped along
            and actually a part of the Host, but were differentiated and lost followers over time. Today they can still be seen in charms or smaller 
            shrines to at least pay reverence to them in an attempt to stave off their dominions. The only exception is The Traveller, who typically 
            is not seen as evil like the rest, but seen as a troublemaker and usually is not seen worshiped in the open as a result.

        <h2>The Church of the Silver Flame</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Diety: The Voice in the Flame</li>
                <li>Followers: The Purified</li>
                <li>Structure: Organized network of temples and clergy</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The other major religion in Khorvaire, this one is much more centralized with nearly uniform churches dotting the continent.
            It is notable in that its diety is a composite of several souls and an ancient purifying force rather than an anthromorphosized concept.
            The primary faith in Thrane, it had successfully spread to other countries before The Inquisition took place, and spread nearly
            halted completely during the Last War after the church took leadership of Thrane. That being said the Purified gained before the 
            Last War tended to remain devout. Many churches, especially outside Thrane teach of forgiveness and redemption more than the typical
            dogma of eradicating evil. Most traditional teachings preach about vanquishing evil in the world, leaving no quarter for the wicked. 
            Much of this comes from the origins of the faith, the figurehead being a column of literal flame that speaks only to the pure of heart. 
            This flame marks the spot a Paladin named Tir Miron and her unnamed Coatl companion who sacrificed their lives to seal away a Demon Lord
            who was wrecking havok across the land. The Flame is said to be the combined souls of Miron, the coatl and the souls of the Purified 
            of the Flame. Even with the rarity of those with even the ability to ressurect the dead, those who can that are of the faith do so very
            sparingly. Between the belief in the gestalt of souls that is their afterlife and having a priority on keeping the sanctity of the soul,
            it is a very frowned upon practice, although some exceptions can be made under extrameous circumstances. 
        </p>
        <p>As stated before, many members of the both the congregation and the clergy are adopting a more progressive stance regarding their place in 
            the world. Followers of the Flame easily see a kinship with practitioners of the Host, although it irks many clergy due to its much looser 
            structure. They also admire the similar goals of the Path of Light, dispite mch ambiguity about that particular religion. Despite the general 
            friendlyness between these religions, the Purified tend to see themselves as 'correct'. They do not appreciate any veneration of the Dark Six,
            believe all practitioners of the Blood of Vol are evil, and are the only organization that takes the myths of the Lords of Dust seriously anymore.
            These beliefs can be exemplified in the subsect known as the Flame Keepers. Originally part of the elite and guard forces of the Silver Flame, some
            of the more traditional minded clergy and military went against newer orders and continued to behave in a zealous manner. Due to the reprocussions of
            the war, The Church has been unable to reign in these rogue forces, much to the chagrin of nearly the entire continent. These forces do not subjugate 
            haphazardly, but have been reported to strongarm smaller communities under the prospect of protection. To their credit, very little supernatural activity
            has happened uner their watch. 
        </p>
        <p>The leader of the Church is known as the Speaker of the Flame. When one reaches around the age of 20 or dies, a new one is chosen from a selection of children
            who are able to interpret the word of the Flame. This selection is very careful due to the belief that the Demon Lord that was sealed away is able to communicate
            through the flames, so that only the pure of heart may be chosen for being unaffected. Unchosen are typically kept as additional advisers or gain admittance to the 
            clergy. The current Speake is Jaela Daren, the first in nearly a generation. The young Half-Orc was chosen a bit older than is typical for the Speaker role, but with
            a several decade abscence of one, she was gladly put in place. It should be noted that the abscence was after the monarchy of Thrane was overthrown by the populace 
            towards the beginnings of the Last War. The royal family traditionally ruled alongside the church, similar to medival England, but they did not seem to hold 
            to the same tenants as the populace and lead very hedonistic lives. Being drug into a war did not help their matters and the Church rose as the governing party for 
            Thrane. Unfortunately, by this time the war was in full swing and Thrane, like every other country did what they had to do to survive.

        <h2>The Blood of Vol</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Diety: None, divinity is within yourself.</li>
                <li>Followers: Seekers and Emerald Claws</li>
                <li>Structure: Two opposing sects who seek to become diefied themselves.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The Blood of Vol is a complicated religion to put it mildly. There are numerous misconceptions about the religion as a whole and especially towards
            the Seekers of the Divinity sect, both due to the actions of the Order of the Emerald Claw, and boths sects' views on life, death and undeath. Said to have
            been founded by Erandis d'Vol of the extinct House Vol, this religion rejects the concept of death and the afterlife in favor of each individual acending through 
            their own spark of divinity. In this pursuit, some have performed deeds of questionable morality in order to either exend their life or even achieve immortality. 
            It seems much of this plays from a fear of the nature of Dollurh, wich practitioners believe is the only true afterlife, and must be avoided at all costs. Due to its 
            sorrid past, it is not typically practiced openly, except in Karrnath, but under more subtle methods, most of the time under charity or other work that aliviates the pain that life gives 
            as it were. Seekers have a much more liberal view on the undead than most others typically would, seeing the use of otherwise rottings husks as simply a resourse to use.
            It is also through their magic specialities that Karrnath was able to develop their slightly intelligent undead legions, utilizing bodies, but without tainting the souls.
            There are rumors of some higher ranking officials within Karrnath and the religion being intelligent undead like vampires or mummies. Facts regarding this are unknown
            at large, but it is commonly believed that this sort of undead corrupts the soul, and therefore one's divinity, so it seems like an unlikely rumor at best.
        </p>The Order of the Emerald Claw however, seems to love using necromancy in all its forms. Claiming to be under the orders of Erandis Vol herself, this sect seeks to remake the world into an
            undead paradise. Largely considered a terrorist organization, this reletively new group has orchastrated numerous attacks on settlements across Khorvaire. After a rather 
            destructive battle agains Thranish templars, their numnbers seem to have dwindled, but many fear that they are simply biding their time and slowly rebuilding.

        <h2>Cults of the Dragon Below</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diety: Varies</li>
                    <li>Followers: Cultists, Hermits, and Warlocks</li>
                    <li>Structure: Depends on the specific diety.</li>
                </ul>
        <p>Not an actual religion the cults are so named, due to the common belief that their worship relates to source of the world's evil, Kyhber. In actuality, very few, if any 
            worship the Dragon herself, with most followings being small sects under a Demon Lord whose bonds are loosening, an abomination that has made contact with mortals, or in 
            some cases, a fledgling, but powerful fey or celestial being. It would be ignorant to state that all who fall under this banner are evil, but due to some lingering 
            paranoia regarding the War and from sects of legitimate threats, most practice stays secret, unfortunatly compounding those fears.

        <h2>The Path of Light</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Diety: None</li>
                <li>Followers: Enlightened</li>
                <li>Structure: Monastic</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This religion from the Kalashtar across the ocean is a bit different from other religions. They do not worship or even recognize a god or higher power
            or even follow a particular set of rules. This faith states that everyone and everything are connected, even the good and evil in the world, and that 
            by improving yourself you can improve everything around you. One of the cheif goals of the religion is to purify Dal Quor from the nightmare spirits that
            currently plague it. Since the Kalashtar can naturally tap into their own psionic abilities, they have dedicated much of their time in meditation and 
            self-reflection to combat these psychic demons. After some immigration to Khorvaire, other groups have taken on the faith as well, but as they require much,
            much more training to even attempt the most basic of psionic abilites, many have focused on making the world around them better more directly. Many individuals
            dedicate their time to helping others through acts of charity and kindness. The Kalashtar Enlightened seem to find this agreeable, seeing as anybody can find 
            or even create their own role to play.

        <p>One of the few religions where the object of worship is physically present, the Undying Court is a bit odd, especially in relation tow the faiths 
            Khorvaire. In Arenal, the Elves have mastered a form of necromancy that utilizes positive energy, creating beings of light and life rather than darkness
            and death. These spiritual beings are forged from the souls of those who perform great deeds in the service of Arenal, otherwise they would typically 
            reincarnate. The Court typically gives advice and information to those who ask, but indirectly rules, letting the still living Elves govern day to day matters.
            Their religious aspect mostly comes into play because they can decide what happened to an Areni when they die. If they perfomred valiently, they are offered 
            a position on the Court, simply reincarnated, or in extreme circumstances, brought back as an undead as punishment. They have some similarities with the Silver 
            Flame in that they both seek to eradicate evil from the world and are often the first line of defence against outside forces, although their use of ended has 
            earned the ire of the Church. 
        </p>
        <p>Being direct decendents of the Aerini Elves, the Elves of Valenar also practice a form of ancestor worship. Being of a different culture however, they do not follow
            the Court, but rather their direct ancestors. Their tenents run along the lines of following in the footsteps of a great hero, or questioning what past expert might
            have done in relevant situations. This faith has also allowed non-elves to join, although higher ranking individuals still run along family lines.

        <h2>Druidic Circles</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Diety: Nature Spirits</li>
                <li>Followers: Druids</li>
                <li>Structure: Rough heirarchy of acting druids.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Another faith that is not a religion in the strictest terms. All Druids venerate various natural spirits, or sometimes fey beings, where they get their powers from.
            but each group may favor certain spirits over others, or have a particualr agenda in mind for their duties. In Khorvaire, most Druids are in the farthest reaches of 
            the Shadow Marches, Q'barra, or the Eldeen Reaches and the oldest have Orcish or Goblin roots. Today there are not too many Circles left with many people joining
            civilization and industry, as of now, they do not seem to be in danger of dying out, but that day may come sooner rather than later. It should also be noted that 
            while the title 'druid' is used for followers, this does not mean that one must be that class. Others like paladins, sorcerers, warlocks, and even bards are fairly 
            common among the circles.
