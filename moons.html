        <h2>The Moons of Eberron</h2>
        <p>Similarly to baseline DnD, existance is made up of intersecting metaphysical planes. Unlike baseline,
            They do not cleanly line up with the four elements or alignments, or even dieties. There are twelve
            moons believed to be physical projections of the planes that make up the universe with one possible 
            additional plane related to dreaming. In general, when using names, the moon and plane can be used interchangably.
            It is currently unknown, aside from simple observation, what the moons are actually like, with only very little documentaion
            of interplanar travel found left behind by the Giants. Everything known from modern sources
            come from observations on their orbits around Eberron, or their effects on Manefest Zones throughout 
            the world. 
        </p>
        <p>Manefest Zones are areas ranging between the size of a small village up to possibly the size of an entire continent 
            that are heavily affected by a particular moon. In general, their effects can ebb and flow with time, but some 
            appear to be permanent, or at the very least exhibit a low, constant effect. Somewhat related, the moons' position 
            in orbit can have effects similar to a manefest zone on a greater scale. Scientific study of these areas have 
            answered many questions about the nature of magic in the universe as well as expose some unsettling truths.
        </p>
        <p>The lunar cycles can also have a direct impact on the way some living beings are born. Some of the moons are 
            responsible for the planetouched races such as Genasi, Tieflings, and Aasimar, wich tends to only affect that particular
            child, although sensitvity to particular moons seem to run in lineages. Although there are constelations in the sky,  it is the 
            moons are used as a sort of zodiac system or for divination. In fact, very little is known about 
            the stars due to the overwhelming presence of twelve moons in comparison. Some myths state that each of the Proginator Wyrms
            created these moons before joining to become the planet Eberron.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Siberys Ring</h2>
        <p>Not actually a moon, but it is the closest heavenly body to Eberron. Named after and in myth believed to be the 
            shattered remains of the Proginator Siberys. The ring is made from Siberys dragonshards, and so is believed by 
            some to be the reason magic is even possible within the world to begin with.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Irian</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Positive Energy</li>
                <li>Life/Light</li>
                <li>Siberys</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This moon functions as the setting's sun. By comparison it is much larger compared to the other moons,
            possibly around the size of Eberron itself. It is the largest source of light for the world, but not heat.
            Very little is known about the moon itself even from Giant research. Its manefest zones are found most often 
            in Aundaire, The Eldeen Reaches and the Talentia Plains. Creatures born during their heights are often perfectly 
            healthy and tend to be stronger than others of similar age, but that tends to even out later in life. The ground
            is extremely fertile, and crops seem to grow much faster, sometimes allowing multiple harvests in a single season.
            Healing and restoration magic is also much stronger here, while necromancy tends to be less effective.
        </p>

        <h2>Fernia</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fire</li>
                <li>Order/Summer</li>
                <li>Kyber/Siberys</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This moon is the second brightest in the sky. Most heat in the world is geothermal, but Fernia seems to also regulate
            it somewhat, with summer cycles being closely related to its orbit. Manefest zones typically result in deserts in hte middle 
            of otherwise fertile fields. Some zones also have the strange effect of preventing creatures from lying, or dispelling illusions.
            From Giant documentation on the moon, it is belived that certain tribes of Devils and Angels living there are responsible for this
            more esoteric effect. Fire magic and magic relating to the truth or despelling other magic works better, while magic related to 
            deception tends to fail more frequently.
        </p>

        <h2>Syrania</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Air</li>
                <li>Peace/Gravity</li>
                <li>Siberys/Eberron</li>
            </ul>
        <p>According to Giant texts, some travel took place to this plane ages ago. It is described as endless fields with constantly
            perfect weather, never reaching night, only twilight at its darkest. It is here that the trees that the floatwood used in 
            airship construction is harvested from seems to originate. Manefest zones vary a bit compared to others, with one in Arenal
            being the only place in Eberron that allows floatwood growth, and the one where Sharn is located, altering the gravity, 
            enabling it be to be built as high as it is. Some smaller zones also house idyllic villages that seem to have avoided effects
            of the Last War. Wind and air magic, alongside magic that effects gravity sees more potential and creatures have an easier time
            resisting magic that forces them to act against their will.
        </p>

        <h2>Risia</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ice/Lightning</li>
                <li>Winter/Storms</li>
                <li>Kyber/Eberron</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Another plane that the Giants seem to have made some contact with. The land is mostly frozen and besieged in constantly raging
            storms. It is believed that the entire continent of Everice is a manefest zone of Risia and Stormhome is the result of a much smaller, weaker
            one. Watching its position in the sky in relation to Fernia and Syrania allows experts to fairly accuratly predict the weather and 
            how long or harsh a coming winter will be. Due to most manefest zones taking place over the ocean or on a inhospitibal continent,
            it is not known what magic, other than cold, electric, and wind are effected. 
        </p>

        <h2>Thelanis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fey</li>
                <li>Seasons/Emotions</li>
                <li>Siberys/Eberron</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Manefest zones of this moon tend to occure far from civilization, with druid sects only coming across them rarely. Large, sprawling forests 
            grow around thise zones as well, making the directly affected zone even more difficult to locate. It is however known, that these forests 
            often act under the influence of their own weather and seasonal patterns, with each season sometimes lasting years on end. Some druids have 
            also reported hightened emotions and senses when nearing some of the smaller or temporary zones. Some myths tell of strange creatures native 
            to the plane who are the ones actually controlling the climate, but are notoriously fickle to deal with. 
        </p>

        <h2>Lamannia</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Lycanthropy</li>
                <li>Strenght/The Wild</li>
                <li>Eberron/Kyber</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Belived to be the source of lycanthropy, due to some Fey influences and the fact that it is in its full state far more often than the 
            other moons are. (Barring Irian, wich is essentially always full.) These zones are rather hard to study, due to seemingly only appearing 
            far from civilization, with even the druids having difficulty finding them. It is believed that Lamannia gives barbarians some of their 
            supernatural ability alongside the moon Shavarath. Like Thelanis study is primarily drawn from surrounding wilderness rather than directly.
            It is infered from these studies that Lammania seems to make magic that changes the body or senses work better and longer, and makes mind
             affecting magic struggle to take hold.
        </p>

        <h2>Daanvi</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Knowlege</li>
                <li>Magic/Innovation</li>
                <li>Eberron/Kyber</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This is one of the few planes with very little information from the Giants, due mostly to its very long orbit, nearly 1000 years! It is 
            thought that each cycle has brought a new age of technology or a rise between different species. Of course, civilizatin still improves and changes 
            even without Daanvi's presence, but it also cannot be ignored that the greatest jumps are when it is near. It is also said that the dragonmarks
            first started appearing during one of Daanvi's zeniths. Its manefest zones are rather subtle compared to others, but in particular, ritual or 
            enchanting magic seems to gain the most effects. It is also theorized that a few 'null zones', where magic is largely unable to function,
            are a type of manefest zone of Daanvi.
        </p>

        <h2>Kythri</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Transmutation/Dimensional</li>
                <li>Change/Liquid</li>
                <li>Eberron</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This strange moon seems to have no orbit at all, either wildly flailing across the sky or sometimes appearing in a difference section of space 
            from night to night. It is because of this that it is believed that all magic involving transporting matter is energized by this particualr moon.
            Manefest zones are also unstable, but in a much different way. Inristingly, through clever tracking procedures and some luck, researchers discovered
            that this particular moon is completly liquid, although the exact material is still unknown. The ground in these zone are plyable by the sheer will of individuals within. This
            effect may have lead to the beginnings of transmutation magic. Thankfully, most of these zones are temporary and as of yet, has not happened in any 
            major population area. Transmutaion and conjoration magic tend both act quicker and last longer under the effects of this moon. Dispellation and other 
            abjuration effects aren't quite as useful as normal. If a manefest zone appears near or even within another pre-existing zone, magic fluctuates wildly
            and is rather unpridictable.
        </p>

        <h2>Shavarath</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>War</li>
                <li>Violence/Martial Prowess</li>
                <li>Ebberon</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This plane is commonly associated acts of war and violence. Manefest zones only show up in battlfields, in some cases, reports 
            of Fiends fighting Angels followed great battles, but with no physical evidence to support this. It is a common superstition that
            weapons forged on battlegrounds are much deadlier, but come with a curse that the wielde must constantly enact violence or thir soul 
            will be consumed by the weapon. While some weapons have been confirmed to be of better quality, it is difficult to coraborate if they 
            were made under the influence of the moon. Alongside Lamannia, it is also belived that a Barbarian gets their inhuman physical ability 
            from this plane. In general, weapons or otherwise physical attacking does greater damage, while non-damaging spells have a harder time 
            taking hold.
        </p>

        <h2>Dolurrh</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Negative Energy</li>
                <li>Death/Salt</li>
                <li>Khyber</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The land of the dead. Other than the very pious, it seems that all souls go here after expiring. Due to the rarity of people retaining their 'memory'
            during their death after being revived, there is not much information on the afterlife, but descriptions believed to be related to this moon are 
            relatively common. Souls of the recently deceased are seen aimlessly wandering around while strange dark shapes seem to stalk many of them. The world 
            resembles Eberron from descriptions, but in ruins and under an unatural darkness. The only unique structure resebles a large castle or fortress in the 
            distance. It is theorized that early contact with this plane lead to several religions with a more positive afterlife being developed. Those belonging 
            to these religions that have been revived either have no memory, or a near textbook description of that religion's version of 
            of the afterlife. Manefest zones tend to weaken healing magic, and those who died in its borders will always arise by the next day as some sort of undead.
            The zones tend not to be able to support life, with water becoming too salty, regardless of it location, and land dries out, becoming small salt plains.
            Karnnath is home to some of the few permanent zones, wich is what enabled them to amass one of the most frightful armies in world history.
        </p>

        <h2>Mabar</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Darkness</li>
                <li>Night/Disapearance</li>
                <li>Kyber</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Tracking of this moon has proven difficult due to it always being in its new state. Sometimes, under the right alignment of moons and stars, you can see 
            a blank space moving across the sky, this is believed to be Mabar. Equally hard to keep track of is its manafest zones. All that is known about them is 
            that they occure in extreme darkness and cause objects and sometimes people to disapear. It is currently unknown where they go. This is rarer than it sounds
            as most sources of light, including moonlight or even candlelight dispells this effect. It greatly affects magic that changes sight and illusions, and 
            hinders dispelling or countering magic.
        </p>

        <h2>Xoriat</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Psychic Energy</li>
                <li>Fear/Chaos</li>
                <li>???</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This moon has no strong association with any of the Proginator Dragons, and is unkown how or even when it was formed. Characterized
            by a strange, green glow, this moon often causes uneasyness to people who look at it for too long. It is believed to be the original 
            home of the Daelkyr, strange, powerful beings who attacked Eberron millenia ago. It was during the war with the Daelkyr that a group of 
            druids known as the Gatekeepers created numerous great sigils that sealed off Xoriat from the world. The moon still orbits, but whatever 
            energies it is host to is inaccesable to the world and any manafest zones were 'locked' in place. These zones tend to generate a sense of 
            unease and are remarkably easy to get lost in. Magic that affects fear and clouds judgement are more potent, as well as reducing resistances
            to such effects. Psychic effects and other forms of mental magic can also have unpredictable side effects.
        </p>

        <h2>Dal Quor</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Psychic Energy</li>
                <li>Dreams</li>
                <li>???</li>
            </ul>
        <p>A ring of astroids looping around much of the planet's system. Believed to once have been a moon, but destroyed by the Giants in an attempt
            to stop an invasion of nightmare creatures. This is difficult to prove or disprove due to the Giant's disapearance from the worl shortly after 
            this war. It is believed by some that the plane associated is a shared dreamscape amongst mortals. Some evidence has arisen for this, mostly 
            regarding proof of the aforemention nightmares, and through corroberation between those with psionic abilities. There are no known manefest zones
            and other than a link to psionc energy, does not seem to affect magic.
