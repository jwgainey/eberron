                            The lands beyond Khorvaire are much different to the cultures of Khorvaire, despite being the origin of many of Khorvaire's people. Most regions have a fairly unified culture when compared to the likes of Khorvaire. Not a whole lot about each region is known to an average Khorvairian, being that international travel outside of mercenary work during the War was fairly rare. With international trade and expeditions being funded again, these regions are seeing their own influx of immigration and travel, though still not on the level as Khorvaire does.Typically, people only speak their native tongue, although Common is seeing an increase as an international trade language. So in general, one shouldn't have too much trouble communicating in larger cities or places of trade, but may have some issues in remote areas.

                        The birthplace of Elven civilization. Although Elves were from Xen'drik originally, they were slaves to the Giants 
                        who ruled it. Many were able to escape during their rule, and set up small colonies, but their culture did not 
                        truly form until the collapse of Giant civilization. Aerenal is widely known for its use of positive-aligned necromancy and its 
                        population of 'undying' citizens. Their belief system involves reincarnating and living multiple lives 
                        until you are deemed virtuous enough to be brought back as a deathless. Further merits allows one to join
                        the Undying Court, the leader on both physical and spiritual matters. Their interactions with the 
                        outside world was typically being hired as mercenaries, leading to colonization and immigration to Khorvaire.
                        Today, they mainly focus on trade, selling exotic fruits and spices, and the ever valuable floatwood.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        A smaller group of Elves known as the Tairnadal live in the mountainous, arid regions in the north. They separated 
                        from the Aereni due to differences in their beliefs, but co-exist peacefully with them. Instead of 'living' along side their 
                        ancestors they attempt to emulate those from their history as a way to honor them, creating a proud warrior culture. 
                        It is actually the Tairnadal who founded Valenar in Khorvaire and as a result, most Elves there are from this lineage
                        and have a stronger disconnect from the Undying Court, although they still reincarnate as if under their influence. 
                        Some Drow live in the Aereni region, but most have kept their home on Xen'drik.

                        The land of Dragons. After the Demon War, Dragons and the few surviving Couatl made there home in the isolated
                        island of Argonnessen. It was here that the dragons discovered great monoliths with intricate carvings detailing
                        past events, as well a present ones. Some that were loosely translated came to pass, so many of the Dragons have devoted
                        their time to translating and understanding these monoliths to protect the future. The events yet to pass are often 
                        unclear, and evidence supports that they are not always clear until they do pass. The Dragons prefer to work and live in 
                        isolation, but will sometimes give invitations to outsiders for a monitored visit. They rarely leave Argonnessen, unless 
                        it is for a specific purpose regarding a prophecy. It is rumored that nearly, if not all creatures from this island are 
                        other types of dragonkin.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        As a whole, not much is known about the culture of the dragons, due to their secrecy, and the Dragonborn of Khorvaire being 
                        so far removed. The last time that a large number of Dragons left was to lead an attack on Xen'drik after the Giants destroyed
                        Dal Quor during the Quori invasion. This essentially threw the remaining Giants back to the stone age and unintentionally freed 
                        the smaller races they had enslaved. During the chaos, Dragons also went to war with the Elves of Aerenal, but withdrew after 
                        realizing they had little to do with the Giants.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        The Chamber is the group of Dragons who directly interact with aspects of the Dragon Prophecy, interpreting its events and sending 
                        lower ranked Dragons as agents to see that they come true or to circumvent them. Their main goal is to keep Eberron from falling 
                        too far into chaos, an so work very much in the back ground, sort of as a neutral or slightly benevolent Illuminati. They are 
                        directly opposed by the Lords of Dust, a cabal of Rakshasa and other demons seeking to use their interpretations of the Prophecy 
                        to free there masters who were imprisoned so long ago.

                        Sarlona is the original home of humans. In fact, other than giant-kin the other races are nearly unheard of within the continent.
                        Sarlona is a little bigger than Khorvaire and just as geographically diverse. It consists of two countries
                        constantly at odds with one another, the Empire of Reidra and Adar. Reidra is extremely insular, having only one port city open to the outside world.
                        Only Humans, Changelings, and giant-kin are allowed within the country proper. Kalashtar are executed on site. This port city is the only
                        window into Reiran life, the laws here must be followed to the letter otherwise perpetrators are dealt with extreme prejudice. The Reidran
                        merchants are known to pay top dollar for relatively easy to procure wears, so many Khorvar seek out trade here for a quick buck.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The country of Adar is nearly inhospitable. It is filled with treacherous mountains and is besieged by constant storms, with only a single valley
                        offering respite.
                        It is here that the psionic humanoids known as Kalashtar are descended. It is believed that Kalashtar were once normal humans, but have bound their 
                        souls with dream spirits, enabling a sort of ancestral psychic link. They are hated by the Reidrans due to their inability to annex Adar and of 
                        influence of the dream spirits.

                        The legendary home of Giants. In ancient times Giant society ruled supreme. They were well beyond today in terms of technology and magic.
                        they altered the course of evolution for some races, believed to have 'created' the Drow who now populate the continent. Legends state that 
                        there was once a thirteenth plane and moon of psychic energy that became corrupted by nightmare spirits. In a great war against this incorporeal
                        foe, the Giants used powerful magic to destroy this moon and forever sever the plane from the world. Their successes however, threw the balance
                        of the planes off and they shortly disappeared after, leaving their creations behind. Except for villages across the northern coastlines, the rest  
                        of the continent is presumably, uninhabited. A few outposts from Khorvar exploration parties have been built, but due to the region's nature, 
                        they have been left un-recovered. The entire continent, except again for the northern coastlines, are constantly shifting, making reliable map making 
                        an impossible task. Some believe this is due to lingering magic from the severing of an entire plane.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The remnants of the Giants regressed into an almost pre-historic state, forming very small hunter-gatherer communities. Giant-kin such as Ogres and
                        Goliaths fared much better, but are still relatively uncommon to see. Firbolgs are amongst the rarest of people to ever meet, living in secluded villages 
                        and very rarely venturing out, sometimes believed to be another lost civilization. Drow are the most common people in Xen'drik, the majority choosing to
                        remain after the mass exodus to Aerenal. Like the Tairnadal, they respect their ancestors, but they do not directly worship them. They have their own religions, 
                        typically involving local spirits.

                        The largely unexplored arctic and antarctic regions of the world. Explorations into the northern Frostfell have been
                        much more successful than in Everice, with a couple of outpost towns still in operation. Expeditions are getting less frequent
                        even though there is some evidence of an ancient civilization further north. As is stands, Everice seems completely 
                        devoid of life barring the sole outpost station and a few reports of strange creatures further in the wastes. As of now, any further exploration is deemed a waste of life and money.

                        The underground labyrinth of caverns spanning the entire world. Named after the Progenitor Dragon who betrayed her siblings,
                        these twisting tunnels make very little sense spatially. Caves that seem to have dead ends can bring you to a different location 
                        when leaving, paths that take weeks to months above ground takes mere days underground, and some caverns are much larger than they
                        should be, lining up with the above world. Despite these spacial anomalies,
                        the paths throughout seem to stay consistent. It is believed that roughly 5% has been explored so far, with more expeditions being 
                        very few and far between. Exploring known entrances to Kyber is considered a sort of taboo, only even being slightly tolerated because
                        of dragonshard mining. The taboo comes from not only its strange nature and associations with the Dragon, but to belief that fiends 
                        from the beginnings of time, the Daelkyr and their aberrant creations, and possibly even worse evils are sealed away in its twisting 
                        corridors.
