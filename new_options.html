        <h2>New Stuff</h2>
        <p>Due to being a completly separate setting from baseline DnD,Eberron has a few things unique to it. 
            There a couple new and familiar, but revamped races, a new class and the introduction of the Dragonmarks,
            esentially variants for the base races, so that they can have inherent spells. In addition anything from an
            offical book is allowed as well as the most recent version of UA classes, psionics in particular have seen a few 
            versions fairly rapidly. Matthew Mercer's books are also acceptable because Blood Hunter is dope. I'm not 
            disallowing other homebrews, but I would like to look at them first, as there has been a recent influx of
            completly broken mechanics, not to mention several new default mechanics in this setting.
        </p>

        <h3>New Races</h3>

        <p>All prior races are avaliable in the world, the first major difference barring Dragonmarks, being your language.
            As long as you are from Khorvaire, you will most likely know Common, although depending on where exactly, it may very well be
            a second, not as well understood language. Your race does not nessesarily dictate your other language, rather the 
            specific country of origin does. For instance, whatever you play, if you are from the Mror Holds, you should know 
            Dwarvish, but if you are a Dwarf born and raised in the Eldeen Reaches, you would probably know Goblin or Orcish alongside Common.
            If you are from another continent entirely, Common would very much be a secondary language, it is typically only used 
            across the seas for trading perposes. Also, the outsider races (Tieflings, Aasimar, Genasi) are typically born from completly average
            people of the humanoid races, but they were affected by the cycles of the moons rather than directly by demons, angels or genies.
            In a similar vein, some subraces are due to interference from ancient societies like the Giants or Dragons, for instance, Drow are not from
            this world's equivalent of the underdark, but are a result of Giant magic affecting the Elves of Xen'Drik. The lifespans for some races
            are also a bit shorter. Dwarves and Gnomes typically live around 300 years, with some living up to 500, but they are considered quite elderly 
            past 300. Firbolgs tend to live around 400-500 as well, but due to their rarity and seclusion, this is difficult to pin down. Halflings 
            and Half-Elves live around 150 years like normal. Elves however only live to around 200, but they are reincarnated in cycles
            of around 800 years. The Elven dieties extended their "lives" so that they may perfect themselves and join their Court. During this cycle, the soul
            is reborn in a new Elf, but as they grow, they tend to only have vague memories of their past lives, but retain a similar personality and talents. 
            After the cycle is complet, they are either welcomed into the Elven afterlife of the Undying Court, move on to a different afterlife of their chosen
            faith, or reicarnated from scratch, beginning the cycle anew if reborn as an elf. The period between lives tends toward a few years, with soul able to
            be resurrected during this time of limbo. Half-Elves are not included in this as they have their own distinction as an entirely separate race, altho very
            few individuals may earn reincarnation directly from the Court. 
            A good thing to keep in mind would be, what are the parents of your character? The three entirely new races are: Changelings, Warforged, and Shifters.
        </p><aside><p>For their stat blocks, see this page:<a href="stats.html">new race stats</a>.</p></aside>

        <h4>Changelings</h4>
        <p>Humanoids with the ability to change their appearance to another of just about any race, they are a 
            largely mistrusted people. Much of this mistrust comes from their natural deception abilities, and were compounded from
            the last war due to their convinient employment in espionoge services. The truth is while some did use their talents for 
            moraly questionable acts during the war, most simply served in more mundane roles, with the vast majority of Changelings 
            keeping only one 'persona' for the majority of their lives, using their talents only under duress. In their 'natural' state
            Changlings tend towards pale or muted skin tones and have nearly white irises and hair. Most who live among other races will
            shift their appearance accordingly. Some try to assimilate into communities without ever revealing what they are, while others
            keep it as an open secret of sorts, but keeping the appearance of the host race. Even fewer keep their base appearance on at 
            all times, unless it is a primarily Changling area, wich are very few and far between. They are also gender-fluid, and freely 
            change between characeristics as they individually see fit. 
        </p>

        <h4>Warforged</h4>
        <p>Created during the last war, Warforged started off simply as advanced constructs or golems to take place of losing lives.
            While more intelligent in a sense, they were still simply non-living, magical/mechanical constructions. Around two decades before 
            the war ended some of the newer models began showing errant 'programming' like disobeying orders or going AWOL, something 
            never seen before. Upon being captured or detained, and following tests, the new generation of Warforged were declared sapient, living beings
            and further production was promptly ceased. The creation forges behind their origions were to be dismantled, besides on or two that were
            confenscated for arcane study. While living and in posession of souls, Warforged have a very different lifespan compared to the other races.
            Being made from a combination of inorganic and magically enhanced organic materials, they do not seem to age. This along with it only being a few
            decades since their conseption, it is currently unkown what age they can reach. Essetially being born as fully grown adults, many Warforged have 
            difficulty processing their emotions, they are not stilted or lacking at all in that sense, they are just more confusing for the average Warforged.
            In general the populace is not sure what to make of these artificial lifeforms, but the ones who have integrated into society have done so without
            too much trouble. For those who have not, there's always someone with money who doesn't like getting their hands dirty.
        </p>

        <h4>Shifters</h4>
        <p>These people are believed to be decended from couplings of lycanthropes and baseline humanoid druids from ancient times.
            In general, a Shifter is similar to a plane-touched, they appear mostly like a humanoid, but have animalistic traits as opposed to planar, 
            essentially furry-lite. Unfortunatley, like the Changelings and the Warforged, Shifters are misunderstood as well. During the 
            <a href="history.html">Lycanthropathic Inquesiton</a> a few centuries ago, Shifters were unjustly slaughtered alongside rampaging lycanthropes.
            Due to the sheer ruthlessness of the Inquisition, the Shifter population was brought down to a fraction of what it originally was. The Church 
            of the Silver Flame has since apologized for their part in the Purge, but many see this as only lip service. Shifters in general tend to avoid more
            densly populated areas as a result and stick to the frontiers or areas under control of the much more amicable Druid Circles.

        <h3>The Artificer</h3>

        <p>Some of you may be somewhat familar with the artficer, expecially if you've been keeping up 
            with the UA, but now there is an offical block for the artificer! The artificer functions as a 3/4 INT based caster who uses potions or 
            gagets to cast their spells and infusions. Infusions act as a sort of buff to temporarily make a mundane item into a wonderous item. They also
            have the ability to create actual magical items with a much more lenient ruleset than if say a Wizard or Sorcerer wanted to create things. 
            For more specific information regarding this class take a look at this page: <a href="artificer.html">the Artificer.</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Dragonmarks</h3>

        <p>Around a millenia ago, some people started developing strange birthmarks that seemed to be the source of innate magical ability. Named 
            Dragonmarks after the belief that they were gifts bestowed from the Proginator Dragons of world-wide myth, this phenomena led to clans dominating trade 
            related to the mark's abilites, eventually forming the Houses, this setting's version of a Mega-Corp. The mark acts a variant or sub race for the ones that 
            are able to take one. They replace the standard ability scores and give some starting spells, as well as the ability for casters to learn related spells,
            regardless of what their actual class is. General info of each Dragonmark will be below, more in depth info of their stats will be on this page: 
            <a href="dragonMarks.html">Dragonmark Stats</a>. and information on the Houses themselves can be found here:<a href="houses.html">Houses</a>.
