        <h3>New Stuff</h3>
        <div id="new stuff" class="infoBlock">
            <p>
                Due to being a completely separate setting from baseline DnD, Eberron has a few things unique to it. 
                There are a couple new and familiar, but revamped races, a new class and the introduction of the Dragonmarks,
                essentially variants for the base races, so that they can have inherent spells. In addition, anything from an
                official book is allowed as well as the most recent version of UA classes, psionics in particular have seen a few 
                versions fairly rapidly. Matthew Mercer's books are also acceptable because Blood Hunter is dope. I'm not 
                disallowing other homebrews, but I would like to look at them first, as there has been a recent influx of
                completely broken mechanics, not to mention several new default mechanics in this setting.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Races</h3>
        <div class="twoBlocks">
            <div id="races" class="infoBlock">

                <p>
                    All prior races are available in the world, the first major difference barring Dragonmarks, being your language.
                    As long as you are from Khorvaire, you will most likely know Common, although depending on where exactly, it may very well be
                    a second, not as well understood language. Your race does not necessarily dictate your other language, rather the 
                    specific country of origin does. For instance, whatever you play, if you are from the Mror Holds, you should know 
                    Dwarvish, but if you are a Dwarf born and raised in the Eldeen Reaches, you would probably know Goblin or Elven alongside Common.
                    If you are from another continent entirely, Common would very much be a secondary language, it is typically only used 
                    across the seas for trading purposes. Also, the planetouched races (Tieflings, Aasimar, Genasi) are typically born from completely average
                    people of the humanoid races, but they were affected by the cycles of the moons rather than directly by demons, angels or genies. These traits
                    tend to follow along family lines, commonly skipping several generations. Planetouched tend to have children of their parent's race unless
                    they are having children with another Planetouched (Two Dwarf-Tieflings are as likely to have a Dwarf as they are a Tiefling). Hollow Ones (Wildemount)
                    are related to the planes as well, but only manifest as one after their death. Different Planetouched
                    parents tend to have children of the variant sub-races of those available, or change inherent elemental affinities, depending on the combination.
                    In a similar vein, some subraces are due to interference from ancient societies like the Giants or Dragons, for instance, Drow are not from
                    this world's equivalent of the underdark, but are a result of Giant magic affecting the Elves of Xen'Drik. The lifespans for some races
                    are also a bit shorter. Dwarves and Gnomes typically live around 300 years, with some living up to 400, but they are considered geriatric 
                    past 300 or so. Tortles live to around 180 or so, instead of 60, because real tortoises are damn near immortal.
                </p><br>
                <p>  
                    Elves however only live to around 200, but they are reincarnated in cycles
                    of around 800 years. The Elven deities extended their "lives" so that they may perfect themselves and join their Court. During this cycle, the soul
                    is reborn in a new Elf, but as they grow, they tend to only have vague memories of their past lives, but retain a similar personality and talents. 
                    After the cycle is complete, they are either welcomed into the Elven afterlife of the Undying Court, move on to the different afterlife of their chosen
                    faith, or reincarnated from scratch, beginning the cycle anew if reborn as an elf. The period between lives tends toward a few years, with souls able to
                    be resurrected during this time of limbo. Half-Elves are not included in this, unless they are directly parented by an Elf, as they have their own 
                    distinction as an entirely separate race. If reincarnated, they will be a full Elf in the next life. Due to the differences in culture and split in the 
                    bloodline from ancient times. Elven-Planetouched
                    are also able to reincarnate as Elves, although they have the normal lifespans, and are pretty rare, coming almost entirely from the lunar cycles, lacking the 
                    bloodline affinities some other races may have. 
                    The four entirely new races are: Changelings, Warforged, Kalashtar, and Shifters.

        <h4>Changelings</h4>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Humanoids with the ability to change their appearance to another of just about any race, they are a 
                    largely mistrusted people. Much of this mistrust comes from their natural deception abilities, and were compounded from
                    the last war due to their convenient employment in espionage services. The truth is while some did use their talents for 
                    morally questionable acts during the war, most simply served in more mundane roles. The vast majority of Changelings 
                    keeping only one 'persona' for the majority of their lives, using their talents only under duress. In their 'natural' state
                    Changelings tend towards pale or muted skin tones and have nearly white irises and hair. Most who live among other races will
                    shift their appearance accordingly. Some try to assimilate into communities without ever revealing what they are, while others
                    keep it as an open secret of sorts, but keeping the appearance of the host race. Even fewer keep their base appearance on at 
                    all times, unless it is a primarily Changeling area, which are very few and far between. They are also gender-fluid, and freely 
                    change between characteristics as they individually see fit. 
                </p>
            </div>

        <h4>Warforged</h4>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Created during the last war, Warforged started off simply as advanced constructs or golems to take place of losing lives.
                    While more intelligent in a sense, they were still simply non-living, magical/mechanical constructs. Around two decades before 
                    the war ended some of the newer models began showing errant 'programming' like disobeying orders or going AWOL, something 
                    never seen before. Upon being captured or detained, and following tests, the new generation of Warforged were declared sapient, living beings
                    and further production was promptly ceased. The creation forges behind their origins were to be dismantled, barring one or two that were
                    confiscated for arcane study. While living and in possession of souls, Warforged have a very different lifespan compared to the other races.
                    Being made from a combination of inorganic and magically enhanced organic materials, they do not seem to age. This along with it only being a few
                    decades since their conception, it is currently unknown what age they can reach. Essentially being born as fully grown adults, many Warforged have 
                    difficulty processing their emotions, they are not stilted or lacking at all in that sense, they are just somewhat confusing for the average Warforged.
                    In general the populace is not sure what to make of these artificial lifeforms, but the ones who have integrated into society have done so without
                    too much trouble. For those who have not, there's always someone with money who doesn't like getting their hands dirty.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Kalashtar</h4>
                <div class="infoBlock">
                    <p>
                        Kalashtar are descendants of the humans who stayed in Sarlona after the massive migration to Khorvaire. Technically speaking, they also have an
                     ancestry of Elven, Giant, and even Fiendish blood as well, but for the most part appear like normal humans. The thing that truly sets them apart as a race
                     however, is that each is bound by soul to a Quori dream spirit. These entities invaded Eberron millennia ago, with some defecting from their kin and rebelling 
                     against the invading forces. Due to their extra-planar nature, they could not survive under normal circumstances, and so bonded with the locals and exchange, 
                     giving them a natural affinity for psychic powers. They mostly keep to their country of Adar in Sarlona, so little is known about their culture beyond what 
                     immigrants have shared. 
                    </p>
                </div>

        <h4>Shifters</h4>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    These people are believed to be descended from couplings of lycanthropes and baseline humanoid druids from ancient times.
                    In general, a Shifter is similar to a plane-touched, they appear mostly like a humanoid, but have animalistic traits as opposed to planar, 
                    essentially furry-lite. Unfortunately, like the Changelings and the Warforged, Shifters are misunderstood as well. During the 
                    <a href="history.html">Lycanthropathic Inquisition</a> a few centuries ago, Shifters were unjustly slaughtered alongside rampaging lycanthropes.
                    Due to the sheer ruthlessness of the Inquisition, the Shifter population was brought down to a fraction of what it originally was. The Church 
                    of the Silver Flame has since apologized for their part in the Purge, but many see this as only lip service. Shifters in general tend to avoid more
                    densly populated areas as a result and stick to the frontiers or areas under control of the much more amicable Druid Circles.

        <h3>The Artificer</h3>
            <div class="infoBlock">

                <p>
                    Some of you may be somewhat familiar with the artificer, especially if you've been keeping up 
                    with the UA, but now there is an official block for the artificer! The artificer functions as a 2/3 INT based caster who uses potions or 
                    gadgets to cast their spells and infusions. Infusions act as a sort of buff to temporarily make a mundane item into a wondrous item. They also
                    have the ability to create actual magical items with a much more lenient rule set than if say a Wizard or Sorcerer wanted to create similar things.

        <h3>Dragonmarks</h3>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Around a millennia ago, some people started developing strange birthmarks that seemed to be the source of innate magical ability. Named 
                    Dragonmarks after the belief that they were gifts bestowed from the Progenitor Dragons, this phenomena led to clans dominating trade 
                    related to the mark's abilities, eventually forming the Houses, this setting's version of a Mega-Corp. The mark acts a variant or sub race for the ones that 
                    are able to take one. They replace the standard ability scores and give some starting spells, as well as the ability for casters to learn thematic spells,
                    regardless of what their actual class is. For instance, a Halfling wizard with the mark of healing can learn some restorative magic, despite those types of 
                    spells not being on the wizards spell list.

            <h2>Groups Patrons</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Beyond the countries and houses, there are many types of organizations that you can meet across Eberron.
                    Many of them need help and are more than willing to look outside their groups for that. Some may be simple
                    contract work, singular jobs, or sometimes even full employment. This section tells of the different types 
                    of Group Patrons, as they are called, and gives a few specific examples well. Also covered will be other groups 
                    of Interest that are under most circumstances un-joinable, but can still have an impact in the game. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Any patrons is able to hire for specific jobs and offer rewards, but most prefer to just employ specialists to 
                    take care of these sorts of problems. They typically offer a salary or some sort of base pay in addition to the 
                    job itself or allowance for the party to keep the loot found. Many also offer the ability to develop new skills 
                    or abilities in addition to the ones normally allowed from your race/class/background. Group patrons can also 
                    greatly affect the autonomy of the party and their decisions. For instance, being part of the military or government,
                    your assignments are orders and must be obeyed or you will receive punishment, while working for a House or 
                    newspaper, you are able to decline a job if you see fit, but declining too many will most likely leave you jobless.
                    Groups like adventurer's guilds tend not to assign jobs, allowing you pick and choose what you do completely.

            <h3>Prosthetics</h3>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Because of the rapid development of new magic and technologies, prosthesis have come a long way from being crude approximations of a limb to
                    highly sophisticated replacements, sometimes even outperforming what one had to begin with. RAW, even a basic prosthetic uses up an attunement slot,
                    but since that's dumb, I've tweaked it a bit so that they are more worth using up a slot for. A mundane replacement, uses no slot, but it also does not 
                    bring one to their full capacity, having a minor penalty on checks or saves. A mechanical or magical replacement however, does take up a slot, but brings
                    you back to square one, and they have customization options with their own bonuses and drawbacks. For possible situations, see below (WIP).
