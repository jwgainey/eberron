Since these countries were built under the same banner long ago, there is a sense of familiarity between the nations, although, the preexisting cultures and natives from before the takeover have developed the nations to have their own differences as well. The Last War has further driven the differences between them as well. The peace between these nations is fairly tenuous at best, many believing that they were on the verge of victory, with only the Mourning holding them back.

                            A smaller nation that faired horribly in the beginning years of the War, losing much of their land to Karrnath and Thrane.
                            After a refocus of their famous aptitude of utility magic towards war magic, they quickly most of the taken lands and rose
                            as a strong contender for the throne. Karrnath wisely stepped back, focusing on other countries in the war, but the animosity 
                            with Thrane remained, resulting in frequent battles until the moment the Treaty was signed. Only being a few years since the
                            end of the War, tensions are still high between these two nations especially concerning the ownership of the city Thaliost.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The economy of Aundair largely relied on the export of produce and livestock, which nearly grinded to a halt during the War.
                            Many of the farmers and laborers became dissatisfied with how the government was dealing with the situation and with help from 
                            the nearby druids of the massive forests in the region seceded from Aundair to form the Eldeen Reaches. It was soon after this 
                            that Aundair refocused their efforts in magic and was able to slowly recover financially. Much of this came from the decision to 
                            allow some of the Houses to own land in their borders, something that was illegal under the Galifar Empire. Because of their now 
                            close alliance to the Houses, Aundair is in a developmental renaissance, focusing on magical studies and culture.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Aracanix is the pride and joy of Aundair. Being the leading magical academy of the entire continent, they are heavily responsible
                            for the advances in magitech for the past few centuries. Most casters from here will be specializing in ritual casting, sacrificing 
                            speed and adaptability, for long lasting, utilitarian magic. Through this and various governmental programs, nearly every home in 
                            Aundair now has magical lighting, cleaning and even entertainment readily available. Aundair also boasts one of the best public school 
                            systems in the continent, losing only to private institutions and Zilargo. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Many Aundairans, the Queen included, would like to see the Eldeen Reaches join back, but that may have unwanted repercussions on the treaties. 
                            As of right now, relations with Thrane are terrible, Karrnath is cold at best, and pleasantly neutral with the majority of Khorvaire.
                            Through the Queen's diplomatic savvy, they also have a strong alliance with Valenar, Talenta, and Lhazaar, something few other countries can claim. 
                            They have the best relations with Cannith North and House Lyrandar, after gifting them the island of Stormhome, now a prestigious resort. House Orien 
                            and House Vidalis also have prominent presence in the nation. It should also be noted that Queen Aurala is married to ex-heir Sasik d'Vidalis, a somewhat 
                            controversial relationship due to previous laws prohibiting such an occurrence.

                            The largest of the five nations, if not the entire continent. Breland was known during the war for having a new trick up its sleeve for nearly 
                            every situation it found itself in. This is due to largely in part to being the the lead in manufacturing, its expansive intelligence network and being a 
                            close ally to Cyre throughout the war. Due to the proximity of these two countries and its sheer size, Breland technically saw the most destruction in its borders, 
                            but most areas of high population are close to the center and costal borders, so they were fairly safe. Also due to its size, Breland hosts two semi independent states 
                            as well. After the loss of Cyre, King Boranel allowed many refugees to make a home now known as New Cyre. Currently all attempts to become fully autonomous have been 
                            unsuccessful. The monstrous Droaam is technically part of Breland as well, not being officially recognized as a free country. It is a source of irritation to the Brelish, 
                            but since it is in the middle of badlands and has little resource value, it has been largely ignored as well.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Breland is home to Cannith South, hosting one of the premier manufacturing facilities in all of the world. Being a close ally of Cyre (HQ to Cannith before its split) allowed 
                            combined with its own focus on more mundane technologies allowed Breland to stay afloat during the War and remained amongst the most stable of countries during this time. With 
                            its large cities, relatively central location in Khorvaire, and proximity to Xen'Drik Breland is a trading powerhouse as well. Much of Breland is fairly arid and not suited to large scale farming and 
                            so relies on importing for the majority of its raw resources. Fairly unique in Khorvaire, Breland has the highest population of monstrous races, even when not including Droaam.
                            This comes from years of mostly peaceful coexistence and from the largely melting pot nature of Breland's population.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Breland is home to the city of Sharn, the largest city in Khorvaire, if not the world. Boasting a skyline nearly at a mile high at its tallest tower, Sharn is a maze of alleyways 
                            and bridges connecting it all together. Sharn houses nearly every culture from around the world, some of the most respected institutions of education and the most renown
                            adventurer's guilds. Like most great cities, Sharn has its share of dark secrets, with rumors of the mysterious House Tarkanan holding their base of operation here, alongside 
                            the alleged crime syndicate of the Boromar Clan. Even the reputable House Cannith is rumored to not entirely be on the up and up.

                            King Boranel is actually the only royal sovereign of the five nations not related by blood to the Galifar Empire. He started as a simple foot soldier during the War, miraculously surviving many battles
                            and becoming something of a legend on the battlefield. He gained his current position through marriage after being declared the most eligible bachelor, essentially through sheer badassness.
                            After the unfortunate death of Queen Valerie he quickly proved to be as talented at leading a nation as he was at fighting. Unfortunately for Breland, his sons are not... widely seen as capable as him.
                            The one son who is not too stupid or a spoiled brat, while intelligent, is much too timid to lead a country and is focusing his time as a scholar. Noticing this as a problem. Boranel decided the Brelish
                            people should be able to decide who their next leader is. After two years of rewriting the constitution and having the first political campaign and elections, Boranel was elected the new 'king' despite 
                            not actually running. The problem involving his sons still has not been solved.

                            Karrnath is possibly the most feared of the countries for good reason. Known for its military might, Karrnath wreaked havoc against 
                            the other nations nearly the entire war. Before being at odds with the continent, Karrnath held the most prestigious military academy, 
                            a title which it is only very slowly reclaiming due to grudges. They also boast the largest standing army across the continent, mostly 
                            likely because of their incorporation of the undead. It is part of life here that when you die, you do not get a burial, you get put to 
                            work. With the mindless undead taking care of the bulk of forces and things like menial or dangerous labor, its living citizens, 
                            are actually able to live comfortable lives, even when not being compared to real-life military dictatorships. The country itself is fairly 
                            bleak, being amongst craggy mountains, dark, thick forests, and near constant rainfall. Its people are able to pursue creative outlets as a 
                            whole more so than some other countries, though the surroundings and future as an undead have a definitive impact on those outlets.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Karrnath is also the only country whose followers are primarily of the Blood of Vol, the Seekers of Divinity to be more precise. While the 
                            religion is not outright outlawed across Khorvaire, it does have a tendency to arouse a great deal of suspicion so followers tend to worship 
                            beneath notice. During the first years of the war, Karrnath was the victim of a prolonged drought and famine, on top of being surrounded by 
                            dangerous enemies. Already being under the influences of the moon Dolurrh, priests of the Blood offered to raise the dead as soldiers for the 
                            slowly dwindling army. Using a variation of rites not typically used in run of the mill necromancy, the priests were able to raise undead in a 
                            much more useful, somewhat intelligent form without also corrupting their souls. In exchange, they were allowed to practice their religion freely 
                            within Karrnath, and an unspecified cost from King Kaius. He died to unknown causes barely a year after this encounter, with his newborn cousin, 
                            named Kaius the II slated as the next heir. This began an indirect dynasty of rulers. Contrary to common belief, The Blood of Vol has a great number
                            of virtues that greatly helped the populace, and has lessened a stigma on the use of undead for more practical purposes. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Kaius IV took the throne after leading a coup against his power hungry uncle, who many feared was leading Karrnath down a irreversible path. This was 
                            towards the end of the war, so amends are yet to be made towards the rest of Khorvaire, although the young Kaius is hopeful about the future. Kaius has 
                            also renegotiated terms with House Deneith, allowing them to be headquartered in the capitol and work in the military academy during peacetime. 
                            The capitol, Korth is also home to Cannith East, who have not done nearly as much as the other two branches beyond outfitting Karrnathi and Deneith soldiers. 
                             Kaius has 
                            also allowed the Twelve, a think tank/watchdog of the Houses to hold their mobile keep within the borders. Some believe this violates a neutrality agreement, 
                            but it seems to helping Karrnath's reputation in the end.

                            Being the first settled lands outside of Sarlona, Karrnath is the oldest human civilization in Khorvaire. The Galifar Empire actually had its beginnings in 
                            this country, leading to its strong military might. Karrnath has a deep respect for the Halflings of the Talenta Plains due to being one of the few regions 
                            able to resist Karrnathi might at nearly every turn. They have a strong alliance with the Mror Holds and Zilargo and a bitter rivalry with Thrane.

                            Home to the Cathedral of the Silver Flame, the heart of the identically named religion. Thrane is ruled by the Keeper of the Flame, a representative who is able to 
                            directly communicate with the sprits in the Silver Flame direct the clergy as those interpretations dictate. The Keeper is chosen from a selection of children who show 
                            great divine attributes with those who fail often become lower members of the clergy. Centuries before the War, the church overthrew the royal government at behest of 
                            its people due to Thrane making strong enemies with the surrounding countries. The ruler at the time believed he had the divine and legal right to the throne (he had neither)
                            and so drug his country down in battles it could hold against, but never truly win. Having enough, the Church allied with the people and led a successful coup,
                            in which the average citizen saw a massive improvement over their lives. This did little to dissuade other countries from finishing ongoing battles, despite the change in 
                            management. The Thranish feel cornered at times, being between two nations with magic superiority during the war. Along with a sharp decline in followers of the Silver Flame 
                            after the war, many Thranish feel uneasy for the country's future in relation to the world. As a result, there are some groups who would like to see a return to monarchy, but 
                            the Church has not budged on this issue. There is also a small, but extremist sect known as the the Pure Flame that seeks to abolish all other religions throughout Khorvaire. 
                            Despite being a very small organization, they have generated fear in the border towns near Aundair and Karrnath from their actions. The Church has denied any involvement, but 
                            has had great difficulty in locating this rogue sect. While under the leadership of the Silver Flame, other religions are tolerated in Thrane although they are a distinct minority. 
                            Due to valuing tradition, Thrane is known for its many grand festivals, although they have been a bit subdued in recent years because of massive debt after the war.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Despite being a theocratic state, the Thranish population enjoys a great deal of freedoms even including the worship of other religions, although the Blood of Vol is met with even 
                            criticism than normal in Khorvaire and cults, both malicious and benign, are almost unheard of. The Sovereign Host has a notable presence as well, though much smaller than elsewhere 
                            in Khorvaire. In some places, the two faiths have merged, with The Flame as the primary deity and the Host as a group of saints. Things like drinking and gambling, while legal, tend
                            to be frowned upon other than during festivities, leading to a more reserved culture than say the very open Breland. Art and culture tends to resolve around the Silver Flame, with 
                            many works sharing similar themes, creating a more unified cultural sector. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The current Keeper of the Flame is Jaela Daran, a young Half-Orc who was chosen much later than usual for one, at around 11 years old. Most are chosen around 7 and raised with church 
                            involvement to become the next keeper. After nearly a generation without a leader, the cardinals expanded their efforts to find a new heir, and found it in an orphan girl, who showed
                            great aptitude for the role. She was unusually, for a Thrane, not raised in the religion, so the learning curve in addition to her late start in learning her duties has created some 
                            problems for members of the Church and population, leading to a small, but noticeable move towards reestablishing the monarchy.

                        <p>
                            Seven years ago, before the end of the Last War, the nation of Cyre was lost. One day a strange grey mist over took the capitol of Metrol and spread across the entire country
                            in less than a day. They only survivors were those who lived near the borders and those who happened to be abroad at the time. Most battles across the continent ground 
                            to halt during the confusion, but it would be a full two years before the peace treaties were officially signed. The corners of the kingdom that were left untouched were 
                            incorporated into the countries of Darguun and Valenar and the affected areas became known as the Mournlands.
                            In the eight years since the end of the war only two expeditions have gone through the Mournlands, both ending tragically. Each time, only a small fraction of explorers returned, 
                            bringing back rather pertinent information regarding the state of Cyre. No bodies have aged a day since the Mourning, it seems that all decomposition has simply ceased. Magic 
                            works strangely, healing magic much weaker than normal, and even fairly mundane wounds have taken much longer to heal, even after leaving the Mournlands. Reports of 
                            'living spells' have been made, evocations and conjurations seemingly acting of their own accord. Lastly, sightings of caravans of Warforged making their way to the old capitol of Metrol, 
                            their purpose remains unknown.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Due to its sudden appearance, catastrophic results, and its many, many anomalous properties, the Mourning is the biggest deterrent against the War reigniting. Researching the Mourning is 
                            taboo between the nations, because while figuring out what happened may benefit society, most countries are fearful if someone else could replicate it. Its not strictly illegal for anyone 
                            to enter the Mournlands, but as it is highly dangerous no exploration has happened since the failed expedition attempts, other than studying the border.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The Cyran people were largely displaced after the war, losing the vast majority of their homeland to the mist and what little that was left to
                            political machinations. Due to being close allies through most of the war, Breland opened its borders and set aside a sizable amount of land for 
                            refugees to make their new home, Starting as a mostly abandoned city, it expanded via shanty towns, but has recently grown in strength. While there 
                            is a ways to go before New Cyre can be considered prosperous, Prince Oargev and his people seem hopeful for its future. Talks of forming into an independent 
                            city-state have been in the works, but are as of now, unsuccessful.

                            Due to its sheer size, the city of Sharn gets special mention. Sharn is the largest city in the world, with buildings reaching nearly a mile in height! This is possible through the Syrania manifest zone in the area, greatly lowering the effects of gravity on especially heavy objects. The city is split into several districts, based on three tiers of elevation and on which of the mesas it is actually built on. Being home to one of the branches of <a>House Cannieth</a> and Morgrave University, Sharn is a popular destination for the ambitious.

                            Located on the southern banks of Brelend, Sharn sees alot of diversity compared to most other cities in Khorvaire. It is not uncommon to see members of the elusive monstrous races coming to and from Sharn, with even a few holding local businesses! Also being on the southern shoreline, Breland is the last stop before excursions to the 'lost' continent of Xen'drik.

                            Sharn also has its share of the uncouth coming through its borders. It is widely believed that the headquarters of the Bormar Clan makes its home here as well as rumors of return of House Tarkanan.
