                <p>
                    Due to the mysterious origins of Eberron and the rise and fall of many civilizations, tracking history 
                    accurately has been difficult to say the least. Things become much clearer during the rule of Galifar Empire 
                    and from records by the Giants many generations before. Most history before that comes from artifacts found in 
                    ruins or through myths and legends passed down through the ages. This is a rough timeline of facts and
                    commonly believed theories of Eberron's past. This is not exhaustive and may not be 100% correct, but in
                    terms of what would be regarded as standard knowledge in setting.

                <p>The three Great Progenitor Wyrms worked together to create the planes of existence, but Kyber betrayed and killed
                    her brother Siberys, shattering his body which became the ring of crystals surrounding the planet. Eberron in revenge,
                    coiled herself around her sister, becoming the world and Kyber becoming the extradimensional space underground. It is 
                    part of this myth that the blood that was spilt gave birth to the races that rose to dominance over the following years. 
                    Their plans for the world before their fight can be divined today through various means, thought it is commonly seen as 
                    superstition in today's age.

            <div class="info-block p-3 mb-5">
                <p>
                    The spawn of Kyber quickly dominate the land at the dawn of time. Devils, Rakshasa, and Night Hags rule various parts of the 
                    world. The Lords, also known as the Rakshasa Raja, are supremely powerful, truly immortal beings whose mere presence distorts 
                    and corrupts nearby reality to their liking. Dragons and mortals are under subjugation while the Couatl stay secluded in what would later become Sarlona. 
                    The mortal races are not abele to develop beyond a very primitive culture due the oppression, while Dragons slowly learn to 
                    control their innate magical abilities.Dragons discover the Dragon Prophecy and journey to Sarlona and meet the Couatl. They decide to join together to overthrow the 
                    Demon Lords.
                    Combining the psionic abilities of the Couatl and the arcane magic the Dragons, the forces tear through the demonic hordes,
                    while the mortal races take cover in the most remote corners of the world and underground. After many centuries the War comes 
                    to a standstill. The majority of the Couatl sacrifice themselves to weaken and bind the remaining Lords and trap them within Kyber,
                    creating the first iteration of the Silver Flame, as this point a world-wide force rather than a single physical manifestation. The Dragons
                    Seclude themselves in Argonnessen to study the Prophecy, and largely ignore the developing mortal races.

            <h2 class="text-center mb-3">The Age of Giants</h2>

            <div class="info-block p-3 mb-5">
                <p>
                    The Giants rise to prominence after the war and quickly take over most of the world, ruling from Xen'drik. They develop technology and magic that has 
                    been unrivaled even to this day. They experiment on the still primitive mortal races, leading directly to many of the subraces and 
                    their inherent magical abilities. The Giants spread their empire across several planes of existence. Dragons and Giants both develope their own brands
                    of magic, but are content to leave each other alone. Some of the smaller races begin to learn magic as well, from observing the Giants and possibly 
                    independently acting Dragons. The Giants begin to focus on the core of their empire in Xen'drik, slowly loosening their hold elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Quori, denizens of the dream-plane of Dal Quor launch an invasion against Eberron sparking a cataclysmic war across the world. Some Quori set a small 
                    enclave in Sarlona, now home to Humans. The mortals are able to hold their own against the extra-dimensional forces, being that most 
                    are concentrated against the Giants. The Giants develop a way to sever the link to Dal Quor completely. This either caused
                    or was because of the destruction of the eponymous moon. In addition, around a third of Xen'drik was lost, leading to the separation 
                    the main land and the islands of Aerenal. After this the land of Xen'drik became turbulent and shifted constantly, many Giants simply 
                    disappeared during this time as well. The remaining Giants were either slain by their former thrall and Dragons, now fearful of their 
                    power, or driven into the depths of the now fluctuating continent. The Elves are able to break from Xen'drik and found their nations in Aerenal,
                    while the Drow stay put in their homelands.
                </p>

            <h2 class="text-center mb-3">The Age of Monsters</h2>

                <p>
                    With the Giants no longer interfering, the mortal races begin to develop culturally in their respective continents. 
                    Goblins claim central and southern Khorvaire and the Orcs claim western Khorvaire. The Lizardfolk and other reptilian
                    races are pushed into southeastern Khorvaire, where they make contact with the newly arrived and previously unknown Dragonborn.
                    Dwarves, Halflings and Gnomes start kingdoms in the unclaimed lands in Khorvaire and the first expeditions from Sarlona and Aerenal 
                    take place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Daelkyr from Xoriat begin to emerge from the depths of Kyber, although the Goblin Dhakanni Empire is able to mostly hold them at bay.
                    During this time however, Humans and Elves begin to conquer areas of Khorvaire, fighting the Goblins who have only just held back Daelkyr 
                    forces. The Orc Druids form the Gatekeepers, who are able to develope a way to seal off Xoriat and stop the invasion without causing the same amount of destruction the Giants did in their case with Dal Quor. They erect seals across the continent, making it impossible for another invasion unless they are destroyed. While most of the Daelkyr were banished back to Xoriat, some of their leaders were in Kyber during the sealing, and are now imprisoned deep within.

            <h2 class="text-center mb-3">The Age of Kings</h2>

            <div class="info-block p-3 mb-5">
                <p>
                    Many kingdoms of Elf and Human are founded across Khorvaire with the Goblins being treated as second class citizens at best, and the more uncommon races(Harpies, Minotaur, Gorgons, etc.) treated as mindless monsters. Dragonmarks make their first appearance and clans revolving around them are formed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Houses start to form around more economical concepts and the Redrian Empire begins its conquest across Sarlona. The War of the Mark takes place as an alliance to end House Tarkanan, due to their aberrant marks. House Vol is also destroyed due to the birth of Erandis Vol. Small bands attempting to rebuild Tarkanan in secret. Karrnath begins a campaign to rule all of Khorvaire and the Houses form their alliance under The Twelve. King Galifar I is born.

                <p>
                    King Galifar ends his campaign, conquering roughly ninety percent of Khorvaire. He splits the Empire into five regions amongst his children. Magic reaches its hight for the mortal races, and several universities are founded, although they are still mostly for the elite. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Raja Bel Salor manages to break free from his confines beneath Thrane, but is stopped by the paladin Tir Mirion and her Couatl companion. They sacrifice their lives to seal away the Demon once more, leaving only a great silver pyre where the event took place. The Church of the Silver Flame begins to develop from this. An large organized attack on western Breland takes place lead by Hags and Gorgons, leading to the first Monster Kingdom.

                <p>
                    The first expeditions to Xen'drik take place, leading to the rediscovery of lost magic and technology. Precursors to modern magitech are developed soon after. King Jarot is born, and his rules brings roadways and the lightning rail to connect all of the Empire together, and education becomes much more accessible to the common folk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to an outbreak of violence from those afflicted with lycanthropy, the Church of the Silver Flame leads crusade to put an end to it. Despite the very real threat (Keith Baker describes it as 28 Days Later, but with werewolves), the Church is scrutinized by their overly brutal methods and fear-mongering as well as the persecution of unaffected Shifters. King Jarot dies relatively young and with a disputed heir, the Last War Begins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the war, technology and magic are developed at an extremely rapid rate. The Houses begin to expand their reach, now that most sovereignty is in question. Many countries begin to split across cultural divides and form separate countries fighting for their own rule. In particular, Cyre is partially taken over by Elven and Goblin mercenaries. The Daughters of Sora Kell also claim independence in western Breland. The first Warforged are developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first airships are also developed around this time, while the Warforged begin to show signs of sapience. The Mourning takes place, destroying the majority of Cyre. Two years later, the Treaty of Thronehold is signed, bringing end to the War after nearly one hundred years. Warforged are granted full rights as living citizens of Khorvaire.
                    A schism between some of the Houses take place and surviving Cyrians attempt to reforge a country.

                    With the Last War ended, and peace reinstated, the world has reopened to trade and adventure. People are trying to regain a sense of normalcy, while others seek a new purpose, a difficult thing after a lifetime of war. Many power groups have formed to keep a check and balance against the governments to keep War from reigniting, and the right of Monarchial rule is called into question. Kyber activity is on a rise as well, leading to many disappearances and deaths across Khorvaire. Your adventure begins here.
