            <h2>Eberron Timeline</h2>
            <p>Due to the mysterious origins of Eberron and the rise and fall of many civilizations, tracking history 
                accurately has been difficult to say the least. Things become much clearer during the rule of Galifar Empire 
                and from records by the Giants many generations before. Most history before that comes from artifacts found in 
                ruins or through myths and legends passed down through the ages. This is a rough timeline of facts and
                commonly believed theories of Eberron's past. This is not exhaustive and may not be 100% correct, but in
                terms of what would be regarded as standard knowledge in setting. The Galifar calendar was established during the
                second dynasty and split in two eras. The years are first counted backwards, like BC 
                and are 'Before Galifar' while years after the founding ar YK 'Year of the Kingdom'.
            </p>

            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <h3 class="bottomTag">Unknown Years Ago</h3>
                <p>The three Great Progenitor Wyrms worked together to create the planes of existence, but Kyber betrayed and killed
                    her brother Siberys, shattering his body which became the ring of crystals surrounding the planet. Eberron in revenge,
                    coiled herself around her sister, becoming the world and Kyber becoming the extradimensional space underground. It is 
                    part of this myth that the blood that was spilt gave birth to the races that rose to dominance over the following eons. 
                </p><br>
            
            <h2>The Age of Demons</h2>

            <h3 class="bottomTag">~10,000,000 BG</h3>
            <p>The spawn of Kyber quickly dominate the land at the dawn of time. Devils, Rakshasa, and Night Hags rule various parts of the 
                world. Dragons and mortals are under subjugation while the Coatl stay secluded in what would later become Sarlona. 
            </p>

            <h3>~1,500,000 BG</h3>
            <p>Dragons discover the Dragon Prophecy and journey to Sarolona and meet the Coatls. They decide to join together to overthrow the 
                Demon Lords.</p>

            <h3>~100,000 BG</h3>
            <p>Combining the psionic abilities of the Coatl and the arcane magic the Dragons, the forces tear through the demonic hordes,
                while the mortal races take cover in the most remote corners of the world and underground. After many centuries the War comes 
                to a standstill. The majority of the Coatls sacrifice themselves to weaken and bind the remaining Lords and trap them within Kyber,
                creating the first iteration of the Silver Flame, as this point a world-wide force rather than a physical manifestation. The Dragons
                Seclude themselves in Argonnessen to study the Prophecy, and largely ignore the mortal races.
            </p><br>

            <h2>The Age of Giants</h2>

            <h3 class="bottomTag">~80,000 BG</h3>
            <p>The Giants rise from the war and quickly take over most of the world, ruling from Xen'drik. They develop technology and magic that has 
                been unrivaled even to this day. They experiment on the still primitive mortal races, leading directly to many of the subraces and 
                their inherent magical abilities. The Giants make contact across several planes of existence. 
            </p>

            <h3>~60,000 BG</h3>
            <p> The Dragons and Giants meet during this time, and seeing each other as contemporaries, teach each other magic, forming the first 
                spells. Some of the subjugated begin to learn from observation. The Giants begin to lessen their hold across the globe,
                secluding themselves and furthering their studies of the planes and the arcane.
            </p>

            <h3>~40,000 BG</h3>
            <p>The Quori, denizens of Dal Quor launch an invasion against Eberron sparking a cataclysmic war across the world. Some Quori set a small 
                enclave in Sarlona, now home to Humans. The mortals are able to hold their own against the extradimensional forces, being that most 
                are concentrated against the Giants. Over time, the Giants develop a way to sever the link to Dal Quor completely. This either caused
                or was because of the destruction of the eponymous moon. In addition, around a third of Xen'drik was lost, leading to the separation 
                the main land and the islands of Arenal. After this the land of Xen'drik became turbulent and shifted constantly, many Giants simply 
                disappeared during this time as well. The remaining Giants were either slain by their former thrall and Dragons, now fearful of their 
                power or driven into the depths of the now fluctuating continent.
            </p><br>

            <h2>Age of Monsters</h2>

            <h3 class="bottomTag">~38,000 BG</h3>
            <p>With the Giants no longer interfering, the mortal races begin to develop culturally in their respective continents. 
                Goblins claim central and southern Khorvaire and the Orcs claim western Khorvaire. The Lizardfolk and other reptilian
                races are pushed into southeastern Khorvaire, where they make contact with the newly arrived and previously unknown Dragonborn.
            </p>

            <h3>~25,000-10,000 BG</h3>
            <p>The Undying Court is founded in Arenal. The Orcs start developing druidic magic. During a minor ice age, Dwarves migrate
                from Frostfell to Khorvaire. The Goblins unite under the Dhakanni Empire and claim the remaining regions of Khorvaire. 
                The eastern region of the Talenta Plains are independent due to the Halfling's bond with the dinosaurs of the area, while
                groups of Areni Elves found Valenar, fighting with the Goblins.
            </p>

            <h3>~8,000-4,000 BG</h3>
            <p>The Daelkyr of Xoriat invades through Kyber, primarily on Khorvaire, with the Goblin Empire largely holding them at bay. Small bands
                of Humans and Valenar Elves also fight against the Goblins during this time. The Dhakanni Empire falls, and Daelkyr forces begin to 
                overrun the continent. The Gatekeeper Druids cast a great magic similar to the Giant's but are able to 
                safely cut off access to Xoriat and seal many of the Daelkyr within Kyber. 
            </p><br>

            <h2>Age of Kings</h2>

                and peacefully co-exist for a time. Erandis Vol is born and house Vol is destroyed during this time period as well. The last remnants of the Goblin 
                empire are destroyed and Karrnath attempts to take over the other nations.

            <p>The Houses start to from from their clans. The remaining Quori from so long ago awaken and lead an assault on Sarlona. Some rebel against 
                their leaders and bond with humans, forming the Kalashtar race. A second wave of humans immigrate to Khorvaire during this time. The 
                War of the Mark takes place to eradicate aberrant dragonmarks. Sharn is founded.
            </p>

            <h3>~490-45 BG</h3>
            <p>The War of the Mark is ended after the death of Lord Tarkanan. Sharn is largely destroyed by Tarkanan and is rebuilt
