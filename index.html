        <h2>What is Eberron?</h2>

        <article id="main_article">

            <div class="twoBlocks">
                <div id="eberron-def" class="infoBlock">
                    <p>
                        Eberron is a dungeon-punk setting. This means it is a fusion 
                        of a more modern, 
                        gritty setting of noir and the heroic fantasy genres. A big component of this is 
                        the presence of magitech, a combination of magic and both mundane and fantastical technology. 
                        While fantasy settings have had this 
                        incorporated fairly commonly, instances of its use were typically either rare or something from an 
                        ancient civilization. In this world technology is fueled and innovated by magic and is 
                        rather commonplace. For instance, the Lightning Rail is a train like we have, except it is
                        powered by a bound lighting elemental instead of steam or batteries. There are  street lights 
                        made from permanent Dancing Lights, wash stations made from lode stones enchanted with 
                        prestidigitation, and magic infused robots, the Warforged.  The setting I’m making is based in
                        a rough technological equivalence of the 20s with much of the magitech being fairly new. 
                        So while in other settings magic can easily replace tech, like Sending or Message instead of
                        radio or cell phones, items are in use much, much more commonly used than casting spells. 
                        The setting could be considered fairly low fantasy due to the lack of mages running around. 
                        Other than a literal handful of powerful caster NPCs in the world, most traditional spellcasting 
                        will be done by you guys. Any other casters will function as very low level casters at best and 
                        typically rely on ritual magic when any is actually in use. This still goes along with the themes 
                        of magic item crafting being more commonplace. That said, magic items, like clothing that changes 
                        color or styles, pens that don’t run out of ink, and illusions as a part of theatrics are part of 
                        everyday use for the majority of people.

            <h2>The Last War</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    The Last War began just over a century ago between the five core nations of Khovaire over a heredity dispute. Since King Jarot had, no heir, 
                    he willed the throne to the princess of Cyre. The other sovereigns felt that she was too young and inexperienced to appropriately fulfill her 
                    duties as Empress and sought to intervene her ascension, with only Aundaire supporting her right. It is difficult to say who 'fired' first so to
                    say, with each ruler shifting the blame among themselves, but the second it rang out, all hell broke loose. In many ways it seems that the peace 
                    of the empire was only held together by the Galfarnian rule, with deep seated wounds between the nations that never actually healed. It began as 
                    border skirmishes between the lands, but due to rapid development of technology and magic, the war swept across the entire continent. The border 
                    countries established alliances with their neighbors, and started to fight against each other as well. Various alliances rose and fell during the war
                    when one country would decide they could annex another, when one did not respond battles, and in some cases, simply when one nation seemed to become 
                    far more threatening. Mercenaries from around the world joined in the fight, eventually having smaller-scale skirmishes of their own, with the only 
                    country to not join in at all being the mysterious Redria on the other side of the world. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    After a century of bloody warfare, no one truly came out on top from this. In fact, the only reason it ended was due to The Mourning, an as-of-yet unidentified event, that 
                    wiped out over 90% of the nation of Cyre. Rightly putting the warring nations on high alert, hostilities died down over the next two years, re-homing the 
                    displaced Cyrians attempting to study the newly named Mournlands. After no useful information was gleamed, the war officially ended with the signing of the 
                    Treaty of Thronehold, which also established and reestablished the nations of Khorvaire. It has been five years since the Last War ended, and while the newfound peace 
                    is greatly appreciated, many are still sore from the events that transpired over the last century. Many believe that their nation would have won, if given a bit more time,
                    others believe, that even more change is necessary in the modern age and that no one should be held at the behest of petty, out-of-touch rulers. and others believe, that 
                    this is little more than a temporary cease-fire, before one thing or another lights the flames of war anew.

            <h2>Religion</h2>
            <div id="main_religion" class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Religion functions a little differently here too. Most, if not all cultures in Eberron recognize
                    the Progenitor Dragon creation myth, in which three great wyrms created the world, its 
                    moons, and the void between them and  within the earth. In most other settings the gods are a 
                    fact, they interact regularly directly or indirectly with the world and channel their 
                    powers through clerics, druids and warlocks. Here, it’s a little more ambiguous, the gods, if they
                    exist, have not felt the need to actually appear or directly intervene in the mortal world. As such,
                    atheists exist in setting and even most religious folk experience doubt from time to time. That being
                    said, there are also a lot of philosophical aspects to the various religions beyond simply worshiping
                    a deity. Divine magic here is powered by the user's faith in an idea than through direct intervention.  
                    
                    None of the traditional deities exist here, beyond small references like spells or a couple 
                    constellations. There are a few physical manifestations of divine beings, but they are definitely 
                    not the norm. These can be seen in the Silver Flame, a spot where a paladin and coatl sacrificed 
                    themselves sealing away a demon and the Undying Court, a group of positive energy powered undead 
                    Elves.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Somewhat related are the existence of Celestial and Fiends. Unlike most settings, where these extraplanar
                    entities have a home plane, and if killed are regenerated there, they both are native to the plane of Eberron.
                    Some of the other planes/moon are home to them as well, and also acts as their home plane, unless they immigrated 
                    from Eberron. They still retain their immortality and ability to simply regenerate after being slain. To combat this 
                    during the Demon Wars, many Fiends were sealed away in specialized crystals or in the depths of Khyber and hindered 
                    from their ability to regenerate. The Rakshasa were largely able to avoid this fate and as a result are the most commonly
                    known Fiends on the surface of Eberron, contributing to Rakshasa being a catch all term for all fiendish types. Similarly,
                    Coatls were once basically the only kind of Celestial seen on Eberron before they collectively gave up their immortality ages
                    ago. Other types of Celestial are sometimes referred to as Coatl, but since their appearances are rare anyway, this does not 
                    commonly come up and they tend to be referred to to on an individual basis.

            <h2>Alignment and Language</h2>
            <div id="alignment" class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Although we usually don’t keep track of alignments anyway, this is actually the first setting 
                    where they are more of  a suggestion than a rule. Every creature's alignment is based entirely
                    on the choices it makes instead of simply what it is. 
                    Another thing to keep in mind is that knowing a language works a little differently. You base 
                    the languages you know on where you’re from instead of your race. You could end up with a Dwarf 
                    that doesn’t know Dwarvish or a Human whose first language was Goblin. For a good chunk of the 
                    world Common is a second or even third language, it was developed as a trade language with only a 
                    few countries eventually adopting it as the official language. Fairly minor in the grand scheme of 
                    things, just something to keep in mind.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The way some languages are portrayed are a bit different as well. Orc is primarily spoken by druids, as
                    the vast majority of Circles were started by Orcs. Essentially it functions as a secondary Druidic language.
                    Drow speak Giant, as they are from the remnants of the Giant empire instead of the underdark. In general, Giant 
                    is also the academic language, due to most arcane knowledge coming from Giant civilization. Funnily enough, because
                    most speakers of Draconic are from the wilderness of Q'Barra, it is seen as a hick language for the most part. The 
                    only religion that uses Celestial in any capacity is the Church of the Silver Flame, mostly for rites and ceremony. 
                    Infernal is spoken entirely by Demonic forces and their followers. The other common languages are typically spoken by 
                    region.

            <h2>Dragonshards</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>
                    Another important facet in Eberron are the dragonshards. These are a crystalline material that can affect,
                    or be affected by magic in various ways. In ancient times, they were believed to be the made from the blood
                    of the Progenitor Dragons, hence the name. Today this is just considered myth, but they remained named after the 
                    Great Wyrms. Overall, each type can be used to replace material components, store spell charges, act as a focus, 
                    be inscribed spells in lieu of a a book, and used in the construction of magical items. Each type also has its own 
                    functionality as well.
                </p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><h4>Siberys</h4> - Typically white, silver, or gold with an opaque, glittery appearance. These shards come from the 
                                ring surrounding the planet. Due to its location around the equator, Xen'drik is the only reliable source of
                                this type of shard. Very occasionally a meteor shower may provide these elsewhere. These shards are known to
                                enhance the natural abilities of those with either Dragonmarks or psionic abilities. As a result they are sought
                                after primarily by the Houses and are known to go for a very high price. Those without such natural abilities can 
                                also benefit from their use, although it takes some training with the material.
                            </li>
                            <li><h4>Khyber</h4> - Usually black, dark purple, or dark grey with red or blue fractals and a cloudy appearance. These 
                                shards are found worldwide, but almost exclusively in the underground region also known as Kyber. The only known surface area they have
                                shown up is in the Demon Wastes of western Khorvaire. These crystals excel at augmenting binding magic. Many vehicles 
                                use elementals bound using Khyber shards implemented in their framework. They are also able to be charged with dimensional
                                or spacial magic, which will nullify their binding capabilities. 
                            </li>
                            <li><h4>Eberron</h4> - Primarily translucent pink or light purple with deep red splashes throughout, these are the most common of dragonshards.
                                They are usually found in shallow veins, prominently in the Shadow Marches, Q'Barra, and Mror Holds regions. These shards
                                are a bit more general purpose compared to the other two, but are much simpler to use and are used in many common household items.
                                These are the ones a spellcaster would typically be seen using as spell components or as a focus.

                            </li>
