        <h2>Eberron - Important Info</h2>

        <article id="main_article">
            <p id="eberron_definition">Eberron is a dungeon-punk setting. This means it is a fusion 
            of a more modern, 
            gritty setting of noir and the heroic fantasy genres. A big component of this is 
            the presence of magitech, while fantasy settings have had this 
            incorporated fairly commonly, instances of its use were either rare or something from an 
            ‘ancient civilization’. In this world technology is fueled and innovated by magic and is 
            rather commonplace. For instance, the Lightning Rail is a train like we have, except it is
             powered by a bound lighting elemental instead of steam or batteries. There are  street lights 
             made from permanent Dancing Lights, wash stations made from lode stones enchanted with 
             prestidigitation and magic infused robots, the Warforged.  The setting I’m making is based in
             a rough technological equivalence of the 20s with much of the magitech being fairly new. 
             So while in other settings magic can easily replace tech, like Sending or Message instead of
             radio or cell phones, items are in use much, much more commonly used than casting spells. 
             The setting could be considered fairly low fantasy due to the lack of mages running around. 
             Other than a literal handful of powerful caster NPCs in the world, most traditional spellcasting 
             will be done by you guys. Any other casters will function as very low level casters at best and 
             typically rely on ritual magic when any is actually in use. This still goes along with the themes 
             of magic item crafting being more commonplace. That said, magic items, like clothing that changes 
             color or styles, pens that don’t run out of ink, and illusions as a part of theatrics are part of 
             everyday use for the majority of people.</p>

            <p id=="main_religion">Religion functions a little differently here too. Most, if not all cultures in Eberron recognize
                the Proginator Dragon creation myth, in wich three great wyrms created the world, its 
                moons, and the void between and  within the earth. In most other settings the gods are a 
                fact, they regularly directly or indirectly interact with the world and channel their 
                powers through clerics, druids and warlocks. Here, it’s a little more ambiguous, 
                not that your characters would know, or really be directly affected by. There are
                pantheons and various creation myths, but who’s right? No one knows for sure (except me).
                The gods arose from ancient tales, philosophies, and on occasion interaction with outside 
                forces, but these were by no means divine forces. Divine magic here is powered by the user's 
                faith in something more than through direct intervention. Although druids can still be powered
                by nature spirits if that’s what the player wants. Also the pantheon is entirely different. 
                None of the traditional deities return here beyond small references like spells or a couple 
                constellations. There are a few physical manifestations of divine beings, but they are definitely 
                not the norm. These can be seen in the Silver Flame, a spot where a paladin and coatl sacrificed 
                themselves sealing away a demon  and the Undying Court, a group of positive energy powered undead 
                Elves.</p>
    
            <p id="main_language">Although we usually don’t keep track of alignments anyway, this is actually the first setting 
                where they are more of  a suggestion than a rule. Every creature's alignment is based entirely
                 on the choices it makes instead of simply what it is.
                Another thing to keep in mind is that knowing a language works a little differently. You base 
                the languages you know on where you’re from instead of your race. You could end up with a dwarf 
                that doesn’t know Dwarvish or a human whose first language was Goblin. For a good chunk of the 
                world Common is a second or even third language, it was developed as a trade language with only a 
                few countries eventually adopting it as the official language. Fairly minor in the grand scheme of 
                things, just something to keep in mind.</p>]
            
            <p> Another important facet in Eberron are the dragonshards. These are a crystaline material that can affect,
                or be affected by magic in various ways. In ancient times, they were believed to be the made from the blood
                of the Proginator Dragons, hence the name, today this is just considered myth, but they remained named after the 
                Great Wyrms. Overall, each type can be used to replace material components, store spell charges, act as a focus, 
                be enscribed spells in lieu of a abook, and used in the construction of magical items. Each type also has its own 
                functionality as well.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Siberys - Typically white, silver, or gold with an opaque, glittery appearance. These shards come from the 
                            ring surrounding the planet. Due to its location around the equator, Xen'drik is the only reliable source of
                            this type of shard. Very occasionally a meteor showere may provide these elsewhere. These shards are known to
                            enhance the natureal abilities of those with either Dragonmarks or psionic abilities. As a result they are sought
                            after primarily by the Houses and are known to go for a very high price. Those without such natural abilites can 
                            also benefit from their use, although it takes some training with the material.
                        </li>
                        <li>Kyber - Usually black, dark purple, or dark grey with red or blue fractals and a cloudy appearance. These 
                            shards are found worldwide, but almost exclusively in the underground region also known as Kyber. The only known surface area they have
                            shown up is in the Demon Wastes of western Khorvaire. These crystals excel at augmenting binding magic. Many vehicles 
                            use elementals bound using Kyber shards inplemented in their framework. They are also able to be charged with dimensional
                            or spacial magic, wich will nullify their binding capabilities. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Eberron - Primarily translucent pink or light purple with deep red splashes throughout, these are the most common of dragonshards.
                            They are usually found in shallow veins, prominaently in the Shadow Marches, Q'Barra, and Mror Holds regions. These shards
                            are a bit more general perpose compared to the other two, but are much simpler to use and are used in many common household items.
                            These are the ones a spellcaster would typically be seen using as spell storage or enchancement as well.
