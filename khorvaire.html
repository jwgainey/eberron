        <h2>Khorvaire as a Whole</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>Long, long ago, Khorvaire was home to the Goblins, who had a continent wide empire, Dwarves, Gnomes and Halflings.
                    Unfortunately for the Goblinkin, their empire was not destined to last. Due to an invasion of the extra-planar beings
                    known as the Daelkyr coming from Kyber below, and the threat of Human and Elven invaders from the seas, the Goblin 
                    forces were spread much too thin to be able to hold their power. The Human and Elves realized far too late at just what 
                    the Goblins were holding back, but were fortunately able to make peace with the Druidic Orcs in the west and the other 
                    races in the eastern continent. The relationship with the Goblins was understandably tumultuous at best for the next millennia.
                    With Humans as the new core power, a new empire rose from the ashes of the Goblin's under the banner of Galifar uniting the countries,
                    who were so often at odds with each other. For over 700 years this peace lasted, until the death of King Jarot I, who had no heir.
                    This spurned the conflict known as the last war which lasted for just under two centuries, only stopping due to the destruction of Cyre. 
                    This conflict redrew most existing maps, with the former kingdoms regaining or losing their lands, new nations gaining independence, and 
                    even a resurgence in the Goblin kingdoms. It has been eight years since the signing of the treaty, but tensions are on the rise yet again
                    and who knows what it would take to stop another war?

        <h2>The Five Core Nations</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>The heart of the fallen Galifar Empire. This five nations united under a single banner and forged a peace throughout the continent
                    that lasted nearly a millennia. Even though they shared a banner, they held their own distinct cultures.
                    As the most populous of the Khorvarian countries, most journeys start here, but by no means do they need to end here as well.

                    A smaller nation that faired horribly in the beginning years of the War, losing much of their land to Karrnath and Thrane.
                    After a refocus of their famous aptitude of utility magic towards war magic, they quickly most of the taken lands and rose
                    as a strong contender for the throne. Karrnath wisely stepped back, focusing on other countries in the war, but the animosity 
                    with Thrane remained, resulting in frequent battles until the moment the Treaty was signed. Only being a few years since the
                    end of the War, tensions are still high between these two nations especially concerning the ownership of the city Thaliost.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The economy of Aundair largely relied on the export of produce and livestock, which nearly grinded to a halt during the War.
                    Many of the farmers and laborers became dissatisfied with how the government was dealing with the situation and with help from 
                    the nearby druids of the massive forests in the region seceded from Aundair to form the Eldeen Reaches. It was soon after this 
                    that Aundair refocused their efforts in magic and was able to slowly recover financially. Much of this came from the decision to 
                    allow some of the Houses to own land in their borders, something that was illegal under the Galifar Empire. Because of their now 
                    close alliance to the Houses, Aundair is in a developmental renaissance, focusing on magical studies and culture.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Aracanix is the pride and joy of Aundair. Being the leading magical academy of the entire continent, they are heavily responsible
                    for the advances in magitech for the past few centuries. Most casters from here will be specializing in ritual casting, sacrificing 
                    speed and adaptability, for long lasting, utilitarian magic. Through this and various governmental programs, nearly every home in 
                    Aundair now has magical lighting, cleaning and even entertainment readily available. Aundair also boasts one of the best public school 
                    systems in the continent, losing only to private institutions and Zilargo. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Many Aundairans, the Queen included, would like to see the Eldeen Reaches join back, but that may have unwanted repercussions on the treaties. 
                    As of right now, relations with Thrane are terrible, Karrnath is cold at best, and pleasantly neutral with the majority of Khorvaire.
                    Through the Queen's diplomatic savvy, they also have a strong alliance with Valenar, Talenta, and Lhazaar, something few other countries can claim. 
                    They have the best relations with Cannith North and House Lyrandar, after gifting them the island of Stormhome, now a prestigious resort. House Orien 
                    and House Vidalis also have prominent presence in the nation. It should also be noted that Queen Aurala is married to ex-heir Sasik d'Vidalis, a somewhat 
                    controversial relationship due to previous laws prohibiting such an occurrence.

                <p>
                    The largest of the five nations, if not the entire continent. Breland was known during the war for having a new trick up its sleeve for nearly 
                    every situation it found itself in. This is due to largely in part to being the the lead in manufacturing, its expansive intelligence network and being a 
                    close ally to Cyre throughout the war. Due to the proximity of these two countries and its sheer size, Breland technically saw the most destruction in its borders, 
                    but most areas of high population are close to the center and costal borders, so they were fairly safe. Also due to its size, Breland hosts two semi independent states 
                    as well. After the loss of Cyre, King Boranel allowed many refugees to make a home now known as New Cyre. Currently all attempts to become fully autonomous have been 
                    unsuccessful. The monstrous Droaam is technically part of Breland as well, not being officially recognized as a free country. It is a source of irritation to the Brelish, 
                    but since it is in the middle of badlands and has little resource value, it has been largely ignored as well.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Breland is home to Cannith South, hosting one of the premier manufacturing facilities in all of the world. Being a close ally of Cyre (HQ to Cannith before its split) allowed 
                    combined with its own focus on more mundane technologies allowed Breland to stay afloat during the War and remained amongst the most stable of countries during this time. With 
                    its large cities, relatively central location in Khorvaire, and proximity to Xen'Drik Breland is a trading powerhouse as well. Much of Breland is fairly arid and not suited to large scale farming and 
                    so relies on importing for the majority of its raw resources. Fairly unique in Khorvaire, Breland has the highest population of monstrous races, even when not including Droaam.
                    This comes from years of mostly peaceful coexistence and from the largely melting pot nature of Breland's population.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Breland is home to the city of Sharn, the largest city in Khorvaire, if not the world. Boasting a skyline nearly at a mile high at its tallest tower, Sharn is a maze of alleyways 
                    and bridges connecting it all together. Sharn houses nearly every culture from around the world, some of the most respected institutions of education and the most renown
                    adventurer's guilds. Like most great cities, Sharn has its share of dark secrets, with rumors of the mysterious House Tarkanan holding their base of operation here, alongside 
                    the alleged crime syndicate of the Boromar Clan. Even the reputable House Cannith is rumored to not entirely be on the up and up.

                    King Boranel is actually the only royal sovereign of the five nations not related by blood to the Galifar Empire. He started as a simple foot soldier during the War, miraculously surviving many battles
                    and becoming something of a legend on the battlefield. He gained his current position through marriage after being declared the most eligible bachelor, essentially through sheer badassness.
                    After the unfortunate death of Queen Valerie he quickly proved to be as talented at leading a nation as he was at fighting. Unfortunately for Breland, his sons are not... widely seen as capable as him.
                    The one son who is not too stupid or a spoiled brat, while intelligent, is much too timid to lead a country and is focusing his time as a scholar. Noticing this as a problem. Boranel decided the Brelish
                    people should be able to decide who their next leader is. After two years of rewriting the constitution and having the first political campaign and elections, Boranel was elected the new 'king' despite 
                    not actually running. The problem involving his sons still has not been solved.

                <p>
                    Karrnath is possibly the most feared of the countries for good reason. Known for its military might, Karrnath wreaked havoc against 
                    the other nations nearly the entire war. Before being at odds with the continent, Karrnath held the most prestigious military academy, 
                    a title which it is only very slowly reclaiming due to grudges. They also boast the largest standing army across the continent, mostly 
                    likely because of their incorporation of the undead. It is part of life here that when you die, you do not get a burial, you get put to 
                    work. With the mindless undead taking care of the bulk of forces and things like menial or dangerous labor, its living citizens, 
                    are actually able to live comfortable lives, even when not being compared to real-life military dictatorships. The country itself is fairly 
                    bleak, being amongst craggy mountains, dark, thick forests, and near constant rainfall. Its people are able to pursue creative outlets as a 
                    whole more so than some other countries, though the surroundings and future as an undead have a definitive impact on those outlets.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Karrnath is also the only country whose followers are primarily of the Blood of Vol, the Seekers of Divinity to be more precise. While the 
                    religion is not outright outlawed across Khorvaire, it does have a tendency to arouse a great deal of suspicion so followers tend to worship 
                    beneath notice. During the first years of the war, Karrnath was the victim of a prolonged drought and famine, on top of being surrounded by 
                    dangerous enemies. Already being under the influences of the moon Dolurrh, priests of the Blood offered to raise the dead as soldiers for the 
                    slowly dwindling army. Using a variation of rites not typically used in run of the mill necromancy, the priests were able to raise undead in a 
                    much more useful, somewhat intelligent form without also corrupting their souls. In exchange, they were allowed to practice their religion freely 
                    within Karrnath, and an unspecified cost from King Kaius. He died to unknown causes barely a year after this encounter, with his newborn cousin, 
                    named Kaius the II slated as the next heir. This began an indirect dynasty of rulers. Contrary to common belief, The Blood of Vol has a great number
                    of virtues that greatly helped the populace, and has lessened a stigma on the use of undead for more practical purposes. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Kaius IV took the throne after leading a coup against his power hungry uncle, who many feared was leading Karrnath down a irreversible path. This was 
                    towards the end of the war, so amends are yet to be made towards the rest of Khorvaire, although the young Kaius is hopeful about the future. Kaius has 
                    also renegotiated terms with House Deneith, allowing them to be headquartered in the capitol and work in the military academy during peacetime. 
                    The capitol, Korth is also home to Cannith East, who have not done nearly as much as the other two branches beyond outfitting Karrnathi and Deneith soldiers. 
                     Kaius has 
                    also allowed the Twelve, a think tank/watchdog of the Houses to hold their mobile keep within the borders. Some believe this violates a neutrality agreement, 
                    but it seems to helping Karrnath's reputation in the end.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Being the first settled lands outside of Sarlona, Karrnath is the oldest human civilization in Khorvaire. The Galifar Empire actually had its beginnings in 
                    this country, leading to its strong military might. Karrnath has a deep respect for the Halflings of the Talenta Plains due to being one of the few regions 
                    able to resist Karrnathi might at nearly every turn. They have a strong alliance with the Mror Holds and Zilargo and a bitter rivalry with Thrane.

                    Home to the Cathedral of the Silver Flame, the heart of the identically named religion. Thrane is ruled by the Keeper of the Flame, a representative who is able to 
                    directly communicate with the sprits in the Silver Flame direct the clergy as those interpretations dictate. The Keeper is chosen from a selection of children who show 
                    great divine attributes with those who fail often become lower members of the clergy. Centuries before the War, the church overthrew the royal government at behest of 
                    its people due to Thrane making strong enemies with the surrounding countries. The ruler at the time believed he had the divine and legal right to the throne (he had neither)
                    and so drug his country down in battles it could hold against, but never truly win. Having enough, the Church allied with the people and led a successful coup,
                    in which the average citizen saw a massive improvement over their lives. This did little to dissuade other countries from finishing ongoing battles, despite the change in 
                    management. The Thranish feel cornered at times, being between two nations with magic superiority during the war. Along with a sharp decline in followers of the Silver Flame 
                    after the war, many Thranish feel uneasy for the country's future in relation to the world. As a result, there are some groups who would like to see a return to monarchy, but 
                    the Church has not budged on this issue. There is also a small, but extremist sect known as the the Pure Flame that seeks to abolish all other religions throughout Khorvaire. 
                    Despite being a very small organization, they have generated fear in the border towns near Aundair and Karrnath from their actions. The Church has denied any involvement, but 
                    has had great difficulty in locating this rogue sect. While under the leadership of the Silver Flame, other religions are tolerated in Thrane although they are a distinct minority. 
                    Due to valuing tradition, Thrane is known for its many grand festivals, although they have been a bit subdued in recent years because of massive debt after the war.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Despite being a theocratic state, the Thranish population enjoys a great deal of freedoms even including the worship of other religions, although the Blood of Vol is met with even 
                    criticism than normal in Khorvaire and cults, both malicious and benign, are almost unheard of. The Sovereign Host has a notable presence as well, though much smaller than elsewhere 
                    in Khorvaire. In some places, the two faiths have merged, with The Flame as the primary deity and the Host as a group of saints. Things like drinking and gambling, while legal, tend
                    to be frowned upon other than during festivities, leading to a more reserved culture than say the very open Breland. Art and culture tends to resolve around the Silver Flame, with 
                    many works sharing similar themes, creating a more unified cultural sector. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The current Keeper of the Flame is Jaela Daran, a young Half-Orc who was chosen much later than usual for one, at around 11 years old. Most are chosen around 7 and raised with church 
                    involvement to become the next keeper. After nearly a generation without a leader, the cardinals expanded their efforts to find a new heir, and found it in an orphan girl, who showed
                    great aptitude for the role. She was unusually, for a Thrane, not raised in the religion, so the learning curve in addition to her late start in learning her duties has created some 
                    problems for members of the Church and population, leading to a small, but noticeable move towards reestablishing the monarchy.

                <p>
                    Seven years ago, before the end of the Last War, the nation of Cyre was lost. One day a strange grey mist over took the capitol of Metrol and spread across the entire country
                    in less than a day. They only survivors were those who lived near the borders and those who happened to be abroad at the time. Most battles across the continent ground 
                    to halt during the confusion, but it would be a full two years before the peace treaties were officially signed. The corners of the kingdom that were left untouched were 
                    incorporated into the countries of Darguun and Valenar and the affected areas became known as the Mournlands.
                    In the eight years since the end of the war only two expeditions have gone through the Mournlands, both ending tragically. Each time, only a small fraction of explorers returned, 
                    bringing back rather pertinent information regarding the state of Cyre. No bodies have aged a day since the Mourning, it seems that all decomposition has simply ceased. Magic 
                    works strangely, healing magic much weaker than normal, and even fairly mundane wounds have taken much longer to heal, even after leaving the Mournlands. Reports of 
                    'living spells' have been made, evocations and conjurations seemingly acting of their own accord. Lastly, sightings of caravans of Warforged making their way to the old capitol of Metrol, 
                    their purpose remains unknown.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Due to its sudden appearance, catastrophic results, and its many, many anomalous properties, the Mourning is the biggest deterrent against the War reigniting. Researching the Mourning is 
                    taboo between the nations, because while figuring out what happened may benefit society, most countries are fearful if someone else could replicate it. Its not strictly illegal for anyone 
                    to enter the Mournlands, but as it is highly dangerous no exploration has happened since the failed expedition attempts, other than studying the border.

                <p>
                    The Cyran people were largely displaced after the war, losing the vast majority of their homeland to the mist and what little that was left to
                    political machinations. Due to being close allies through most of the war, Breland opened its borders and set aside a sizable amount of land for 
                    refugees to make their new home, Starting as a mostly abandoned city, it expanded via shanty towns, but has recently grown in strength. While there 
                    is a ways to go before New Cyre can be considered prosperous, Prince Oargev and his people seem hopeful for its future. Talks of forming into an independent 
                    city-state have been in the works, but are as of now, unsuccessful.

                    The western half of this country was never part of the empire, being under control of various Druidic tribes that were able to maintain their independence. The eastern half
                    were recently part of Aundair until many of the towns banded together to secede after feeling left behind or neglected by Aundair during the war. With the focus on the more metropolitan
                    areas, the Druids from the nearby Towering Wood came to their aid. After years of this, the farming communities decided to ally themselves with the Druids instead of their homeland and 
                    formed the Reaches. Being the largest source of produce and livestock for the continent, they were able to financially hold their ground while the treaties were being drawn up. Today, they 
                    have a relative peace with Aundair, although Queen Aurala would very much like the Reaches back in her fold.

                    intact of these ruins, causing the area to be targeted by united Goblin war bands under the banner of a Hobgoblin known as Sharaat'kor. This area was not seriously considered
                    its own country until the Day of Mourning which left Darguun almost entirely unaffected. Being that very few Cyrans even lived here and the likelihood that Sharaat'kor could
                    prolong the war, it was agreed to make this region independent as the new home of the Goblin Empire.

                    Aerenai and Tairnai Elves (who already had a small independent area in the region), giving them much more economy and political power than they had before. During the War, the Elves 
                    slowly expanded their reach until the events of the Mourning, when they officially claimed what is now  the country of Valenar. The country consists mostly of separate towns with military
                    officers running each area. They are slowly shifting government styles, leading to many diplomats and politician types to move to Valenar.

                    A collection of loosely allied clans in the Ironroot Mountains. Many of the clans are Dwarvish, altho some prominent Gnome and Halfling clans are present as well.
                    Other races can be part of these clans, but typically would not have a stand alone clan. Home to the banking conglomerate House Kundarak, Mror is one of the wealthiest nations
                    also due in part to its rich systems of mineral veins. The Holds have been successful in keeping fairly self-reliant, preferring to keep to themselves in most matters.
                    This has allowed the Mror to develop strange technologies and uncover otherworldly magic unseen in the rest of the world. Although the Holds have an overall alliance with Karrnath
                    and Breland, they were able to mostly avoid the war due to the difficulty getting armies through a mountain range. Contrary to most settings, the Dwarves here do not live underground,
                    but in idyllic communities in the valleys above. This actually stems from a rebellion against a Dwarvish kingdom that was deep underground. It is currently uknown what became of this 
                    kingdom.

                    Q'Barra is another region that was a contested area between various factions. Due to the difficulty traversing the jungles and swamps, the battles took place mostly at the border. 
                    A group of Cyran refugees and deserters tired of the War managed to peacefully ally themselves with the various tribes within. Lizardfolk, Tortles, Grung, Dragonborn, and Kobolds 
                    found themselves better able to repel the skirmishes at the border and were eventually able to stay out of the war afterwards. The new group of denizens made a sort of formal government
                    in the border city of Newthrone, enabling the region as an independent country while keeping their own cultures in tact deeper within. There is also evidence of Draconic civilization 
                    within its borders. Due to its treacherous terrain, little has been done to study these points of interest as of yet.

                    as a whole during the War. Tribes of Orc druids held power here before humans immigrated and integrated into their society. Today the Marches are populated 
                    mostly by Half-Orcs with the few Orcs remaining choosing to stay in isolated villages. Sarash'ak is considered the capitol, only because, that is where 
                    the House's headquarters is located, making it the most important town to the rest of the continent. Using their native marks, much of the industry revolves around
                    mining, being second only to the Mror Holds, and to a lesser extent, bounty hunting and mercenary work.

                    On the surface, Zilgaro seems like a utopia, the cities are clean, education is among the best in the world, and society functions like clockwork. But it did not get
                    this way through lax laws. Zil laws are amongst the strictest in all Khorvaire, while many personal liberties are present, curfews are in effect, red tape is everywhere,
                    and the national police, The Trust, is rarely argued with. The most important thing in Zilgaro is the status quo, as long as one doesn't interfere with this, they have 
                    nothing to fear. This has developed an intricate web of intrigue throughout the country. All in all as long as you follow the rules, or become very good at seeming like you are,
                    Zilgaro may be one of the most pleasant places to live.

                    Zil citizens elect officials collectively known as the Triumvirate with a head representing one of five regions. They represent the citizenry and tend to make decisions based
                    on their platforms, but sometimes a vote on issues established for the people as well. Laws are enforced by the Trust, which actually has nearly a third of the population in its 
                    fold. This does not mean that a third of the countries are cops, but a majority of its citizens are obligated to report crimes they see, but typically give warnings before trouble 
                    starts. The agents of the Trust however are allowed to directly intervene, arresting or even killing miscreants depending on the severity. Both of these are done extremely discreetly
                    rarely making a scene. Through these efforts, Zilgaro has the absolute lowest crime rate across Khorvaire, in fact it is fairly rare to see citizens with any sort of armaments within 
                    city borders. The majority of the population believes that the Trust keeps them safe.

                    It is believed that Kyber is closest to the surface here, hence reports of demonic and abberant activity, from the few surviving expeditions.
                    Rumors state that beyond the wild tribes of Tieflings and barbarians, the Rakasha Raja of legend lay in wait biding their time to strike out against the world once again.
