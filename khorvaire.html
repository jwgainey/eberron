                            The rest of the countries of Khorvaire are either newly formed ones during and since the War, ones who never joined the empire to begin with, or simply was not desired by the empire.Their cultures are more distinct compared to those of the Five Nations. Common is treated more as a trade language here, and is still, well, commonly known, although the historical languages are much more widespread. Overall, they seem to be taking to the peace much better than Old Galifar, but lack a true unity should the War reignite again.

                            The western half of this country was never part of the empire, being under control of various Druidic tribes that were able to maintain their independence. The eastern half
                            were recently part of Aundair until many of the towns banded together to secede after feeling left behind or neglected by Aundair during the war. With the focus on the more metropolitan
                            areas, the Druids from the nearby Towering Wood came to their aid. After years of this, the farming communities decided to ally themselves with the Druids instead of their homeland and 
                            formed the Reaches. Being the largest source of produce and livestock for the continent, they were able to financially hold their ground while the treaties were being drawn up. Today, they 
                            have a relative peace with Aundair, although Queen Aurala would very much like the Reaches back in her fold.

                            Being built on top of the ruins of an ancient Goblin empire, Khorvaire hosts many goblinoid ruins. The southern region of Cyre seemed to host the most
                            intact of these ruins, causing the area to be targeted by united Goblin war bands under the banner of a Hobgoblin known as Sharaat'kor. This area was not seriously considered
                            its own country until the Day of Mourning which left Darguun almost entirely unaffected. Being that very few Cyrans even lived here and the likelihood that Sharaat'kor could
                            prolong the war, it was agreed to make this region independent as the new home of the Goblin Empire.

                            Another former region of Cyre, Valenar was a contested spot between several countries, and even a couple of upstart Emperors, who were promptly squashed. Many sides in the war hired 
                            Aerenai and Tairnai Elves (who already had a small independent area in the region), giving them much more economy and political power than they had before. During the War, the Elves 
                            slowly expanded their reach until the events of the Mourning, when they officially claimed what is now  the country of Valenar. The country consists mostly of separate towns with military
                            officers running each area. They are slowly shifting government styles, leading to many diplomats and politician types to move to Valenar.

                            A collection of loosely allied clans in the Ironroot Mountains. Many of the clans are Dwarvish, altho some prominent Gnome and Halfling clans are present as well.
                            Other races can be part of these clans, but typically would not have a stand alone clan. Home to the banking conglomerate House Kundarak, Mror is one of the wealthiest nations
                            also due in part to its rich systems of mineral veins. The Holds have been successful in keeping fairly self-reliant, preferring to keep to themselves in most matters.
                            This has allowed the Mror to develop strange technologies and uncover otherworldly magic unseen in the rest of the world. Although the Holds have an overall alliance with Karrnath
                            and Breland, they were able to mostly avoid the war due to the difficulty getting armies through a mountain range. Contrary to most settings, the Dwarves here do not live underground,
                            but in idyllic communities in the valleys above. This actually stems from a rebellion against a Dwarvish kingdom that was deep underground. It is currently uknown what became of this 
                            kingdom.

                            Q'Barra is another region that was a contested area between various factions. Due to the difficulty traversing the jungles and swamps, the battles took place mostly at the border. 
                            A group of Cyran refugees and deserters tired of the War managed to peacefully ally themselves with the various tribes within. Lizardfolk, Tortles, Grung, Dragonborn, and Kobolds 
                            found themselves better able to repel the skirmishes at the border and were eventually able to stay out of the war afterwards. The new group of denizens made a sort of formal government
                            in the border city of Newthrone, enabling the region as an independent country while keeping their own cultures in tact deeper within. There is also evidence of Draconic civilization 
                            within its borders. Due to its treacherous terrain, little has been done to study these points of interest as of yet.

                            Consisting of vast grasslands and savannahs, nomadic Halfling communities made their home here. Permanent settlements have only existed here for a relatively short
                            time, after the founding of Houses Ghallanda and Jorosco. The Plains went unconquered for nearly as long as civilization has been on Khorvaire, due to many tribe's 
                            domestication of dinosaurs. In fact, alongside Q'Barra and the Shadow Marches, the Plains are amongst the least affected by the War. The cultures between each tribe 
                            varies greatly, with the only truly unifying feature being their great sense of freedom.
                            Today the tribes are mostly independent from one another and the few cities present are slowly gaining ground
                            in terms of population and influence.

                            The Marches are another loose confederation of individualists only recently declared a country. The marches are highly enigmatic with House Tharashk only being discovered by Khorvaire
                            as a whole during the War. Tribes of Orc druids held power here before humans immigrated and integrated into their society. Today the Marches are populated 
                            mostly by Half-Orcs with the few Orcs remaining choosing to stay in isolated villages. Sarash'ak is considered the capitol, only because, that is where 
                            the House's headquarters is located, making it the most important town to the rest of the continent. Using their native marks, much of the industry revolves around
                            mining, being second only to the Mror Holds, and to a lesser extent, bounty hunting and mercenary work.

                            On the surface, Zilgaro seems like a utopia, the cities are clean, education is among the best in the world, and society functions like clockwork. But it did not get
                            this way through lax laws. Zil laws are amongst the strictest in all Khorvaire, while many personal liberties are present, curfews are in effect, red tape is everywhere,
                            and the national police, The Trust, is rarely argued with. The most important thing in Zilgaro is the status quo, as long as one doesn't interfere with this, they have 
                            nothing to fear. This has developed an intricate web of intrigue throughout the country. All in all as long as you follow the rules, or become very good at seeming like you are,
                            Zilgaro may be one of the most pleasant places to live.

                        <p>
                            Zil citizens elect officials collectively known as the Triumvirate with a head representing one of five regions. They represent the citizenry and tend to make decisions based
                            on their platforms, but sometimes a vote on issues established for the people as well. Laws are enforced by the Trust, which actually has nearly a third of the population in its 
                            fold. This does not mean that a third of the countries are cops, but a majority of its citizens are obligated to report crimes they see, but typically give warnings before trouble 
                            starts. The agents of the Trust however are allowed to directly intervene, arresting or even killing miscreants depending on the severity. Both of these are done extremely discreetly
                            rarely making a scene. Through these efforts, Zilgaro has the absolute lowest crime rate across Khorvaire, in fact it is fairly rare to see citizens with any sort of armaments within 
                            city borders. The majority of the population believes that the Trust keeps them safe.

                        <p>
                            Being the home of House Sivis, Zilgaro is the hub of sharing information. With an alliance with House Orien, Zilgaro has the most widespread newspaper in the world in the 
                            <em>Korranburg Chronicle</em>. The combined efforts of both Houses also functions an international postal service. Korrenburg, the capitol, also is home to the most prestegious 
                            university in the Library of Korranburg. The Library is open to all who seek knowledge of any sort, and even offers free classes to the public for remidial skills.

                            This archipelago houses many ex-navy, pirate, and privateers from the war. A lot of sailors previously wanted for piracy were granted pardons for aiding in the war efforts, and
                            were awarded the islands of the Lhazaar Archipeligo as a new home. Disgruntled veterans, citizens, and even House members set off to claim stakes in this new, free land. There is no 
                            central governance, a spokesperson is usually elected as needed, only for the time needed, anyone who steps over their bounds is quickly dealt with. Laws are as a result, very lax, there
                            is an honor system in place, alongside a deep sense of protecting what is yours.

                            The Nation of Monsters. From ages of being rejected if not outright persecuted by the societies of Khorvaire, the monstrous races always lived on the fringes of civilization. Banding together during the war, 
                            and under the leadership of the three Daughters of Sora Kell, a legendary Night Hag, many many of these folk laid claim to the largely abandoned wastes in the western reaches of Breland. No longer
                            alone in the wilderness, they formed a functioning society despite being at odds with nearly anyone around them. Out there, they were hunted and slaughtered for existing, but here they can thrive. Those with
                            unusual or inconvenient needs can find them met, and there is some increase in trade with the outside world via House Tharashk, as they were the only organization who bothered to try negotiating peacefully. 
                            While they mostly keep within their borders, some groups have saw fit to raid nearby settlements giving those who try to integrate in Khorvaire life a bad name.

                           This region was left entirely alone durning the reign of Galifar due to its difficulty to reach, much less survive in, and its apparent lack of resources. It is widely believed that Fiends and Hags who survived the Demon Wars at the beginning of time make their home deep in the wastes. Many roving bands of the barbaric Carrion Tribes worship these Fiends and keep outsiders from coming in. There is a also a large Orc tribe known as Gaash'kala that has made friendly relations with expeditions, often rescuing the lost or leading explorers out of the Wastes. They believe the Wastes have a corrupting effect however, and will not allow those who have stayed too long to leave, usually offering them a home and a purpose in holding back the evils that take their place here. It should also be noted that they worship a force known as the Binding Spirit, who has many uncanny similarities to the Silver Flame, although with just enough differences to be considered a different entity, possibly with a similar origin.
