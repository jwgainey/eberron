        <h2>Khorvaire as a Whole</h2>
        <p>Long, long ago, Khorvaire was home to the Goblins, who had a continent wide empire, Dwarves, Gnomes and Halflings.
            Unfortunately for the Goblinkin, their empire was not destined to last. Due to an invasion of the extra-planar beings
            known as the Daelkyr coming from Kyber below, and the threat of Human and Elven invaders from the seas, the Goblin 
            forces were spread much too thin to be able to hold their power. The Human and Elves realized far too late at just what 
            the Goblins were holding back, but were fortunately able to make peace with the Druidic Orcs in the west and the other 
            races in the eastern continent. The relationship with the Goblins was understandably tumultuous at best for the next millenia.
            With Humans as the new core power, a new empire rose from the ashes of the Goblin's under the banner of Galifar uniting the countries,
            who were so often at odds with each other. For over 700 years this peace lasted, until the death of King Jarot I, who had no heir.
            This spurned the conflict known as the last war wich lasted for just under two centuries, only stopping due to the destruction of Cyre. 
            This conflict redrew most existing maps, with the former kingdoms regaining or losing their lands, new nations gaining independance, and 
            even a resurgance in the Goblin kingdoms. It has been eight years since the signing of the treaty, but tentions are on the rise yet again
            and who knows what it would take to stop another war?
        </p>

        <h2>The Five Core Nations</h2>
        <p>The heart of the fallen Galifar Empire. This five nations united under a single banner and forged a peace throughout the continent
            that lasted nearly a millenia. Even though they shared a banner, they held their own distinct cultures throughout this peace, and through the war.
            As the most populous of the Khorvarian countries, most journeys start here, but by no means do they need to end here as well.
        </p><br>

        <h3>Aundair</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ruler: Queen Aurala ir'Wynarn</li>
                <li>Governance: Socialist Monarchy</li>
                <li>Cities: Fairhaven, Arcanix</li>
                <li>Languages: Common, Orcish/Goblin</li>
            </ul>
        <p>A small nation that suffered more from trade agreements than from the brutality of the war itself. The country was able to defend itself throughout 
            most of the war through its use of magic rather than reliance on newer war machines. Unfortunately, the use of this magic was seen as a threat, 
            so the nation was the victem of many strangleholds and suffered greatly finacially, which lead to the country of the Eldeen Reaches to form and 
            scede from Aundair. However, after the peace treaties were signed, Aundair is recovering quite nicely thanks in no small part to many Houses relocating 
            their headquarters there. Despite losing the lands of the Reaches and some cities to Thrane, Aundair saw fit to give the large island Stormhome to the fledgling House
            Lyrandar, who promptly turned the dangerous island into a popular resort town. Due to its central location in the continent, House Orien bases their main stations hear, 
            and the head of Cannith East appreciates the reletive isolation, but ability to get where she need to go fairly quickly.</p>
            
        <p>Aracanix is the pride and joy of Aundair. Being the leading magical academy of the entire contient, they are heavily responsible for the advances in magitech
            the past few centuries. Even though magical items are taking the place of magical spells in recent years, the study of the arcane is still seen as a highly noble pursuit.
            Most casters from here will be specializing in ritual casting, sacrificing speed and adaptability, for long lasting, practical magic. Through this and various governmental 
            programs, nearly every home in Aundair now has magical lighting, cleaning and even entertainment readily availiable. Aundair also boasts on of the best public school systems
            in the contient, losing only to private institutions. 
        </p>
        <p>Many Aundairans, the Queen included would like to see the Eldeen Reaches join back, but that may have unwanted reprocussions on the treaties. As of right now, relations with
            Thrane and Karrnath are the most volitile, as Thrane annexed a number of towns into their own country and Karrnath seemed to pick the most battles against Aundair. As a result of this,
            the Silver Flame is not a popular religion and the borders with Karrnath are watched vigorously, waiting for anything of note to happen.
        </p><br>

        <h3>Breland</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ruler: King Boranel ir'Wynarn</li>
                <li>Governance: Democratic Monarchy</li>
                <li>Cities: Wroat, Sharn</li>
                <li>Languages: Common, Goblin/Undercommon/Halfling</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The largest of the five nations, if not the entire continent. Breland was known during the war for having a new trick up its sleeve for nearly every situation it found itself in.
            This is due to largely in part to being the the lead in manufacturing, its expansive intelligence network and being a close ally to Cyre during the war. Due to the proximity of 
            these two countries and its sheer size, Breland technically saw the most destruction in its borders, but most areas of high population are close to the center, so they were fairly safe.
            Also due to its size, Breland hosts two semi independant states as well. After the loss of Cyre King Boranel allowed many refugees to make a home now known as New Cyre. Currently all 
            attempts to become fully autonomous have been ignored. The monsterous Droaam is technically part of Breland as well, not being offically recognized as a free country. 
            It is a source of irritation to the Brelish, but since it is in the middle of badlands and has little recource value, it has been largely ignored as well.
        </p>
        <p>King Boranel is actually the only soverign of the five nations not related by blood to the Galifar Empire. He started as a simple foot soldier during the War, miraculously surviving many battles
            and becomeing something of a legend on the battlfield. He gained his current position through marriage after being declared the most eligible bachelor, essentially through sheer badassness.
            After the unfortunate death of the Queen he quickly proved to be as talented at leading a nation as he was at fighting. Unfortunately for Breland, his sons are not... widely seen as capable as him.
            The one son who is not too stupid or a  spoiled brat, while intelligent, is much too timid to lead a country and is focusing his time as a scholar. Noticing this as a problem. Boranel decided the Brelish
            should be able to decide who their next leader is. After two years of rewritting the constitution and having the first politcal campain and elections, Boranel was elected the new 'king' despite 
            not actually running. The problem involving his sons still has not been solved. 
        </p>
        <p>Breland is home to the city of Sharn, the larget city in Khorvair, if not the world. Known as the City of Towers, Sharn is rather small, horizontally. It truely shines in the way its 
            built vertically. Nearly a mile high at its tallest tower, Sharn is a maze of towers and alleyways and bridges connectingit all together. Sharn houses nearly every culture from around the world, some of the most respected institutions of education and the most renown
            adventurer's guilds. Like most great cities, Sharn has its share of dark secrets, with rumors of the mysterious House Tarkanan holding their base of operation here, along side the crime syndicate
            of the Boromar Clan. Even the reputable House Cannith is rumored to not entirely be on the up and up.
        </p><br>


    <h3>Karrnath</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ruler: Kaius ir'Wynarn III</li>
            <li>Governance: Military Dictatorship</li>
            <li>Cities: Korth, The Twelve</li>
            <li>Languages: Common, Dwarvan/Undercommon</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Karrnath is possibly the most feared of the countries for good reason. Known for its military might, Karrnath wreaked havok against the other nations nearly the entire war. Before being at odds with the continent, 
        Karrnath held the most prestigious military academy, a title wich it is only very slowly reclaiming due to grudges. They also boast the largest standing army across the continent, mostly likely because of their incorperation
        of the undead. It is part of life here that when you die, you do not get a burial, you get put to work. With the mindless undead taking care of the bulk of forces and things like menial or dangerous labor, its living citizens, 
        are actually able to live comfortable lives, even when not being compared to real-life military dictatorships. The country itself is fairly bleak, being amongst craigy mountains, dark, thick forests, and near constant rainfall.
        its people are able to persue creative outlets as a whole moreso than some other countries, though the surroundings and future as an undead has a definitive impact on those outlets.
    </p>
    <p>Kaius III took the throne after leading a coup against his power hungery uncle, who many feared was leading Karrnath down a irreversable path. This was towards the end of the war, so amends are yet to be made towards the rest of Khorvaire,
        although the young Kaius is hopeful about the future. Kaius has also renegotiated terms with House Deneith, allowing them to be headquartered in the capitol and work in the military academy during peacetime. Kaius has also allowed
        the Twelve, a think tank/watchdog of the Houses to hold their mobile keep within the borders. Some believe this violates a neutrality agreement, but it seems to helping Kannarth's reputation in the end.
    </p><br>

    <h3>Thrane</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ruler: Jaela Dalen</li>
            <li>Governance: Theocracy</li>
            <li>Cities: Flamekeep</li>
            <li>Languages: Common, Gnomish</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Home to the Cathedral of the Silver Flame, the heart of the identically named religion. Thrane was founded after a paladin and a couatl sacrificed their lives to seal away a demon lord nearly two millenia ago. The ground was marked with a silver 
        flame, said to house the souls of all three. The paladin and coatl speak virtues and the shadow in the flame speaks vices, wich you must resist. Being a theocracy, Thrane is home the most clerics and paladins in the world. Its leadership
        is also not tied to blood, but to the chosen children who are able to interpret the voices that come from the flames. Its current leader is Jaela Dalen, a young Half-Orc girl from rather humble beginnings. Due to the curcumstances under how 
        the previous leader was discharged, Jeala started a bit older than one typically would and is seen as a bit of a problem child. In actuality, she is a normal teenager.
    </p>
    <p>The Thranish feel cornered at times, being between two nations with magic superiority during the war. Along with a sharp decline in followers of the Silver Flame after the war, many Thralish feel uneasy for the country's future in relation to the world.
        As a result, there are some groups who would like to see a return to monarchy, but the church has not budged on this issue. There is also a small, but extremist sect known as the the Pure Flame that seeks to abolish all other
        religions throughout Khorvaire. Despite being a very small organization, they have generated fear in the border towns near Aundair Karrnath from their actions. The Church has denied any involvement, but has had great difficulty in locating this rogue sect.
        While under the leadership of the Silver Flame, other religions are tolerated in Thrane although they are a distinct minority. Due to valuing tradition, Thrane is known for its many grand festivals, although they have been a bit subduded in recent years 
        because of massive debt after the war.
    </p><br>

    <h3>Cyre the Mournlands</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ruler: Oargev ir'Wynarn</li>
            <li>Government: Semi-Independant State</li>
            <li>Cities: New Cyre, Metrol</li>
            <li>Languages: Common, Elven</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Two years before the end of the Last War, the nation of Cyre was lost. One day a strange grey mist over took the capitol of Metrol and spread across the entire country
        in less than a day. They only survivors were those who lived near the borders and those who happened to be abroad at the time. Most battles across the continent ground to halt during the confusion, but it would be
        a full two years before the peace treaties were offically signed. The corners of the kingdom that were left untouched were incorperated into the countries of Darguun and Valenar and the affected areas became known as the Mournlands.
        In the eight years since the end of the war only two expeditions have gone through the mournlands, both ending tragically. Each time, only a small fraction of explorers returned, 
        bringing back rather pernant information regarding the state of Cyre. No bodies have aged a day since the Mourning, it seems that all decomposition has simply ceased. Magic works strangely, healing magic much weaker than normal,
        and even fairly mundane wounds have taken much longer to heal, even after leaving the Mournlands. Reports of 'living spells' have been made, evocations and conjorations seemingly 
        acting of their own accord. Lastly, sightings of caravans of Warforged making their way to the old capitol of Metrol, their perpose remains unknown.
    </p>
    <p>The Cyran people were largely displaced after the war, losing the vast majority of their homeland to the mist and what little that was left to
        political machinations. Due to being close allies through most of the war, Breland opened its borders and set aside a sizable amount of land for refugees to make their new home,
        Starting as a mostly abandoned city, it expanded via shanty towns, but has recently grown in strength. While there is a ways to go before New Cyre can be considered prosperous, 
        Prince Oargev and his people seem hopeful for its future. Talks of forming into an independant city-state have been in the works, but are as of now, unsuccessful. 
    </p><br>

    <h3>Thronehold</h3>
    <p>Not truely a counrty, Thronehold Keep was set as a netural ground to govern the various countries under one empire. With the death of the imperial family, it has largely been
        abandoned with the exception of Deneith vassals who still guard its halls against tresspassers.
    </p><br><br>

    <h2>The Rest of Khorvaire</h2>
    <p>The rest of the contries of Khorvaire are either newly formed ones during and since the war, ones who never joined the empire to begin with, or simply was not desired by the empire.
        Their cultures are more distinct compared to those of the Five Nations, but have maintained a stong alliance with the others as well as a disire to keep the peace.
    </p><br>

    <h3>The Eldeen Reaches</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ruler: None</li>
            <li>Governance: Druid Circles, Townships and Homesteads</li>
            <li>Cities: Greenheart</li>
            <li>Languages: Orcish, Common</li>
        </ul>
    <p>The western half of this country was never part of the empire, being under control of various Druidic tribes that were able to maintain their independance. The eastern half
        were recently part of Aundair untill many of the towns banded together to scede after feeling left behind or neglected by Aundair during the war. With the focus on the more metropolitan
        areas, the Druids from the nearby Towering Wood came to their aid. After years of this, the farming communites decided to ally themselves with the Druids instead of their homeland and 
        formed the Reaches. Being the largest source of produce and livestock for the continent, they were able to financially hold their ground while the treaties were being drawn up. Today, they 
        have a relative peace with Aundair, although Queen Aurla would very much like the Reaches back in her fold.
