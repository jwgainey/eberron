        <h2>Khorvaire as a Whole</h2>
            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>Long, long ago, Khorvaire was home to the Goblins, who had a continent wide empire, Dwarves, Gnomes and Halflings.
                    Unfortunately for the Goblinkin, their empire was not destined to last. Due to an invasion of the extra-planar beings
                    known as the Daelkyr coming from Kyber below, and the threat of Human and Elven invaders from the seas, the Goblin 
                    forces were spread much too thin to be able to hold their power. The Human and Elves realized far too late at just what 
                    the Goblins were holding back, but were fortunately able to make peace with the Druidic Orcs in the west and the other 
                    races in the eastern continent. The relationship with the Goblins was understandably tumultuous at best for the next millennia.
                    With Humans as the new core power, a new empire rose from the ashes of the Goblin's under the banner of Galifar uniting the countries,
                    who were so often at odds with each other. For over 700 years this peace lasted, until the death of King Jarot I, who had no heir.
                    This spurned the conflict known as the last war which lasted for just under two centuries, only stopping due to the destruction of Cyre. 
                    This conflict redrew most existing maps, with the former kingdoms regaining or losing their lands, new nations gaining independence, and 
                    even a resurgence in the Goblin kingdoms. It has been eight years since the signing of the treaty, but tensions are on the rise yet again
                    and who knows what it would take to stop another war?

            <div class="infoBlock">
                <p>The heart of the fallen Galifar Empire. This five nations united under a single banner and forged a peace throughout the continent
                    that lasted nearly a millennia. Even though they shared a banner, they held their own distinct cultures.
                    As the most populous of the Khorvarian countries, most journeys start here, but by no means do they need to end here as well.

                    A small nation that suffered more from trade agreements than from the brutality of the war itself. The country was able to defend itself throughout 
                    most of the war through its use of magic rather than reliance on newer war machines. Unfortunately, the use of this magic was seen as a threat, 
                    so the nation was the victim of many strangleholds and suffered greatly financially, which lead to the country of the Eldeen Reaches to form and 
                    secede from Aundair. However, after the peace treaties were signed, Aundair is recovering quite nicely thanks in no small part to many Houses relocating 
                    their headquarters there. Despite losing the lands of the Reaches and some cities to Thrane, Aundair saw fit to give the large island Stormhome to the fledgling House
                    Lyrandar, who promptly turned the dangerous island into a popular resort town. Due to its central location in the continent, House Orien bases their main stations hear, 
                    and the head of Cannith East appreciates the relative isolation, but ability to get where she need to go fairly quickly.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Aracanix is the pride and joy of Aundair. Being the leading magical academy of the entire continent, they are heavily responsible for the advances in magitech
                    the past few centuries. Even though magical items are taking the place of magical spells in recent years, the study of the arcane is still seen as a highly noble pursuit.
                    Most casters from here will be specializing in ritual casting, sacrificing speed and adaptability, for long lasting, practical magic. Through this and various governmental 
                    programs, nearly every home in Aundair now has magical lighting, cleaning and even entertainment readily available. Aundair also boasts one of the best public school systems
                    in the continent, losing only to private institutions. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Many Aundairans, the Queen included would like to see the Eldeen Reaches join back, but that may have unwanted repercussions on the treaties. As of right now, relations with
                    Thrane and Karrnath are the most volatile, as Thrane annexed a number of towns into their own country and Karrnath seemed to pick the most battles against Aundair. As a result of this,
                    the Silver Flame is not a popular religion and the borders with Karrnath are watched vigorously, waiting for anything of note to happen.

                <p>
                    The largest of the five nations, if not the entire continent. Breland was known during the war for having a new trick up its sleeve for nearly every situation it found itself in.
                    This is due to largely in part to being the the lead in manufacturing, its expansive intelligence network and being a close ally to Cyre during the war. Due to the proximity of 
                    these two countries and its sheer size, Breland technically saw the most destruction in its borders, but most areas of high population are close to the center, so they were fairly safe.
                    Also due to its size, Breland hosts two semi independent states as well. After the loss of Cyre King Boranel allowed many refugees to make a home now known as New Cyre. Currently all 
                    attempts to become fully autonomous have been ignored. The monstrous Droaam is technically part of Breland as well, not being officially recognized as a free country. 
                    It is a source of irritation to the Brelish, but since it is in the middle of badlands and has little resource value, it has been largely ignored as well.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    King Boranel is actually the only royal sovereign of the five nations not related by blood to the Galifar Empire. He started as a simple foot soldier during the War, miraculously surviving many battles
                    and becoming something of a legend on the battlefield. He gained his current position through marriage after being declared the most eligible bachelor, essentially through sheer badassness.
                    After the unfortunate death of Queen Valerie he quickly proved to be as talented at leading a nation as he was at fighting. Unfortunately for Breland, his sons are not... widely seen as capable as him.
                    The one son who is not too stupid or a spoiled brat, while intelligent, is much too timid to lead a country and is focusing his time as a scholar. Noticing this as a problem. Boranel decided the Brelish
                    people should be able to decide who their next leader is. After two years of rewriting the constitution and having the first political campaign and elections, Boranel was elected the new 'king' despite 
                    not actually running. The problem involving his sons still has not been solved.

                <p>
                    Breland is home to the city of Sharn, the largest city in Khorvair, if not the world. Boasting a skyline nearly at 
                     a mile high at its tallest tower, Sharn is a maze and alleyways and bridges connecting it all together. Sharn houses nearly every culture from around the world, some of the most respected institutions of education and the most renown
                    adventurer's guilds. Like most great cities, Sharn has its share of dark secrets, with rumors of the mysterious House Tarkanan holding their base of operation here, alongside the alleged crime syndicate
                    of the Boromar Clan. Even the reputable House Cannith is rumored to not entirely be on the up and up.

                <p>
                    Karrnath is possibly the most feared of the countries for good reason. Known for its military might, Karrnath wreaked havoc against the other nations nearly the entire war. Before being at odds with the continent, 
                    Karrnath held the most prestigious military academy, a title which it is only very slowly reclaiming due to grudges. They also boast the largest standing army across the continent, mostly likely because of their incorporation
                    of the undead. It is part of life here that when you die, you do not get a burial, you get put to work. With the mindless undead taking care of the bulk of forces and things like menial or dangerous labor, its living citizens, 
                    are actually able to live comfortable lives, even when not being compared to real-life military dictatorships. The country itself is fairly bleak, being amongst craggy mountains, dark, thick forests, and near constant rainfall.
                    Its people are able to persue creative outlets as a whole moreso than some other countries, though the surroundings and future as an undead have a definitive impact on those outlets.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Karrnath is also the only country whose followers are primarily of the Blood of Vol, the Seekers of Divinity to be more precise. While the religion is not outright outlawed across Khorvaire, it does have a tendency to arouse 
                    a great deal of suspicion so followers tend to worship beneath notice. During the first years of the war, Karrnath was the victim of a prolonged drought and famine, on top of being surrounded by dangerous enemies. Already being 
                    under the influences of the moon Dolurrh, priests of the Blood offered to raise the dead as soldiers for the slowly dwindling army. Using a variation of rites not typically used in run of the mill necromancy, the priests were able 
                    to raise undead in a much more useful, somewhat intelligent form without also corrupting their souls. In exchange, they were allowed to practice their religion freely within Karrnath, and an unspecified cost from King Kaius. He 
                    died to unknown causes barely a year after this encounter, with his newborn cousin, named Kaius the II slated as the next heir. This began an indirect dynasty of rulers. Contrary to common belief, The Blood of Vol had a great number
                    of virtues that greatly helped the populace, and lessened a stigma on the use of undead for more practical purposes. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Kaius IV took the throne after leading a coup against his power hungry uncle, who many feared was leading Karrnath down a irreversible path. This was towards the end of the war, so amends are yet to be made towards the rest of Khorvaire,
                    although the young Kaius is hopeful about the future. Kaius has also renegotiated terms with House Deneith, allowing them to be headquartered in the capitol and work in the military academy during peacetime. Kaius has also allowed
                    the Twelve, a think tank/watchdog of the Houses to hold their mobile keep within the borders. Some believe this violates a neutrality agreement, but it seems to helping Kannarth's reputation in the end.

                    Home to the Cathedral of the Silver Flame, the heart of the identically named religion. Thrane was founded after a paladin and a couatl sacrificed their lives to seal away a demon lord nearly two millenia ago. The ground was marked with a silver 
                    flame, said to house the souls of all three. The paladin and coatl speak virtues and the shadow in the flame speaks vices, wich you must resist. Being a theocracy, Thrane is home the most clerics and paladins in the world. Its leadership
                    is also not tied to blood, but to the chosen children who are able to interpret the voices that come from the flames. Its current leader is Jaela Dalen, a young Half-Orc girl from rather humble beginnings. Due to the curcumstances under how 
                    the previous leader was discharged, Jeala started a bit older than one typically would and is seen as a bit of a problem child. In actuality, she is a normal teenager.

                <p>
                    The Thranish feel cornered at times, being between two nations with magic superiority during the war. Along with a sharp decline in followers of the Silver Flame after the war, many Thralish feel uneasy for the country's future in relation to the world.
                    As a result, there are some groups who would like to see a return to monarchy, but the church has not budged on this issue. There is also a small, but extremist sect known as the the Pure Flame that seeks to abolish all other
                    religions throughout Khorvaire. Despite being a very small organization, they have generated fear in the border towns near Aundair Karrnath from their actions. The Church has denied any involvement, but has had great difficulty in locating this rogue sect.
                    While under the leadership of the Silver Flame, other religions are tolerated in Thrane although they are a distinct minority. Due to valuing tradition, Thrane is known for its many grand festivals, although they have been a bit subduded in recent years 
                    because of massive debt after the war.

                <p>
                    Two years before the end of the Last War, the nation of Cyre was lost. One day a strange grey mist over took the capitol of Metrol and spread across the entire country
                    in less than a day. They only survivors were those who lived near the borders and those who happened to be abroad at the time. Most battles across the continent ground to halt during the confusion, but it would be
                    a full two years before the peace treaties were officially signed. The corners of the kingdom that were left untouched were incorporated into the countries of Darguun and Valenar and the affected areas became known as the Mournlands.
                    In the eight years since the end of the war only two expeditions have gone through the Mournlands, both ending tragically. Each time, only a small fraction of explorers returned, 
                    bringing back rather pertinent information regarding the state of Cyre. No bodies have aged a day since the Mourning, it seems that all decomposition has simply ceased. Magic works strangely, healing magic much weaker than normal,
                    and even fairly mundane wounds have taken much longer to heal, even after leaving the Mournlands. Reports of 'living spells' have been made, evocations and conjurations seemingly 
                    acting of their own accord. Lastly, sightings of caravans of Warforged making their way to the old capitol of Metrol, their purpose remains unknown.

                    The Cyran people were largely displaced after the war, losing the vast majority of their homeland to the mist and what little that was left to
                    political machinations. Due to being close allies through most of the war, Breland opened its borders and set aside a sizable amount of land for refugees to make their new home,
                    Starting as a mostly abandoned city, it expanded via shanty towns, but has recently grown in strength. While there is a ways to go before New Cyre can be considered prosperous, 
                    Prince Oargev and his people seem hopeful for its future. Talks of forming into an independent city-state have been in the works, but are as of now, unsuccessful.

                    were recently part of Aundair until many of the towns banded together to secede after feeling left behind or neglected by Aundair during the war. With the focus on the more metropolitan
                    areas, the Druids from the nearby Towering Wood came to their aid. After years of this, the farming communities decided to ally themselves with the Druids instead of their homeland and 
                    formed the Reaches. Being the largest source of produce and livestock for the continent, they were able to financially hold their ground while the treaties were being drawn up. Today, they 
                    have a relative peace with Aundair, although Queen Aurla would very much like the Reaches back in her fold.

                    Being built on top of the ruins of an ancient Goblin empire, Khorvaire hosts many goblinoid ruins. The southern region of Cyre seemed to host the most
                    intact of these ruins, causing the area to be targeted by united Goblin war bands under the banner of a Hobgoblin known as Sharaat'kor. This area was not seriously considered
                    its own country until the Day of Mourning which left Darguun almost entirely unaffected. Being that very few Cyrans even lived here and the likelihood that Sharaat'kor could
                    prolong the war, it was agreed to make this region independent as the new home of the Goblin Empire.

                    Originally belonging to unclaimed land, a Cyran general hired Aereni mercenaries in an attempt to claim his own kingdom. Gradually his kingdom spread into claimed lands, and being
                    tired of his war mongering, the Elven mercenaries led a coup against his standing army and were awarded the previously unclaimed lands to do as they see fit. In part of shame from their 
                    actions, and the novelty of being in a new place, the Aereni Elves formed the small nation of Valenar. The army of mercenaries split into independent groups and founded townships across 
                    the arid landscape, often employing their martial prowess in the oncoming wars. After the Last War, Valenar claimed a small section of unruled Cyre for their own, with no one particularly 
                    wanting to argue with them about it. Other than Breland, who has the most immigrants in general, Valenar also hosts the most immigrants from Xen'Drik, the land of Giants.

                    A collection of loosely allied clans in the Mror Mountain Range. Many of the clans are Dwarvish, altho some prominent Gnome and Halfling clans are present as well.
                    Other races can be part of these clans, but typically would not have a stand alone clan. Home to the banking conglomerate House Kundrak, Mror is one of the wealthiest nations
                    also due in part to its rich systems of mineral veins. The Holds have been successful in keeping fairly self-reliant, preferring to keep to themselves in most matters.
                    This has allowed the Mror to develop strange technologies and uncover otherworldly magic unseen in the rest of the world.

                    Originally founded by yet another Cyran who wished for his own empire, Q'Barra was an unclaimed land due to its difficulty to traverse.
                    Determined to forge a new dynasty, this Cyran quickly discovered that while the land was unclaimed in official terms, was not uninhabited. Isolated tribes of Dragonborn,
                    Kobolds, Lizardfolk, Tortles and Grung made their home in the mazes of rivers and rain forests throughout the region. Having a change of heart, the Cyran elected to represent 
                    these isolated people to integrate them into Khorvarian society. Today a leader is chosen from its populace and is given the last name of the Cyran who led to its unification.
                    During the war, Q'Barra was largely avoided, but did provide much needed assistance to its allies.

                    Consisting of vast plains, nomadic Halfling communities made their home here. Permanent settlements have only existed here for a relatively short
                    time, after the founding of Houses Ghallanda and Jorosco. The Plains went unconquered for nearly as long as civilization has been on Khorvaire, due to many tribe's 
                    domestication of dinosaurs. Today the tribes are mostly independent from one another and the few cities present are slowly gaining ground
                    in terms of population and influence.

                    The Marches are another loose confederation of individualists only recently declared a country. The marches are highly enigmatic with House Tharashk only being discovered by Khorvaire
                    as a whole during the War. Tribes of Orc druids held power here before humans immigrated and integrated into their society. Today the Marches are populated 
                    mostly by Half-Orcs with the few Orcs remaining, choosing to stay in isolated villages. Sarash'ak is considered the capitol, only because, that is where 
                    the House's headquarters is located, making it the most important town to the rest of the continent. Using their native marks, much of the industry revolves around
                    mining, being second only to the Mror Holds, and to a lesser extent, bounty hunting and mercenary work.

                    On the surface, Zilgaro seems like a utopia, the cities are clean, education is among the best in the world, and society functions like clockwork. But it did not get
                    this way through lax laws. Zil laws are amongst the strictest in all Khorvaire, while many personal liberties are present, curfews are in effect, red tape is everywhere,
                    and the national police, The Trust, is rarely argued with. The most important thing in Zilgaro is the status quo, as long as one doesn't interfere with this, they have 
                    nothing to fear. This has developed an intricate web of intrigue throughout the country. All in all as long as you follow the rules, or become very good at seeming like you are,
                    Zilgaro may be one of the most pleasant places to live.

                    were awarded the islands of the Lhazaar Archipeligo as a new home. Disgruntled veterans, citizens, and even House members set off to claim stakes in this new, free land. There is no 
                    central governance, a spokesperson is usually elected as needed, only for the time needed, anyone who steps over their bounds is quickly dealt with. Laws are as a result, very lax, there
                    is an honor system in place, alongside a deep sense of protecting what is yours.

                    The Nation of Monsters. From ages of being rejected if not outright persecuted by the societies of Khorvaire, the monstrous races always lived on the fringes of civilization. Banding together during the war, 
                    and under the leadership of the three Daughters of Sora Kell, a legendary Night Hag, many many of these folk laid claim to the largely abandoned wastes in the western reaches of Breland. No longer
                    alone in the wilderness, they formed a functioning society despite being at odds with nearly anyone around them. Out there, they were hunted and slaughtered for existing, but here they can thrive. Those with
                    unusual or inconvenient needs can find them met, and there is some increase in trade with the outside world via House Tharashk, as they were the only organization who bothered to try negotiating peacefully. 
                    While they mostly keep within their borders, some groups have saw fit to raid nearby settlements giving those who try to integrate in Khorvaire life a bad name.

                    Not much is known about the western coasts of Khorvaire. Named so because of the belief that the demons from ancient times are somehow trapped in the canyons and volcanic fields of this region.
                    It is believed that Kyber is closest to the surface here, hence reports of demonic and abberant activity, from the few surviving expeditions.
                    Rumors state that beyond the wild tribes of Tieflings and barbarians, the Rakasha Raja of legend lay in wait biding their time to strike out against the world once again.
