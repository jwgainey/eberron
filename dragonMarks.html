                    The dragonmarks are strange, arcane birthmarks that started appearing on people around a millennia ago. They
                    bestow innate magical abilities to their bearer, typically along lines of a certain theme or function. Those 
                    who bore the marks banded together to form clans that revolved around performing tasks that the marks gave them
                    advantages at, eventually becoming the Houses who have dominated the world economy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply put
                    they act a variant race, for instance, an Elf with the Mark of Shadow could still be a wood elf, high elf, or Drow,
                    but their stats and abilities come from the mark instead. You definitely get a bit more mileage out of them if you're
                    some sort of caster, but even if you aren't, its still a viable option. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, each mark gives a different stat increase, a d4 bonus to certain checks, innate magic, an expanded spell list,
                    and occasionally an extra ability.
