                It has been 5 years since the end of the Last War. Even though the countries of Khorvaire have stopped fighting, its effects
                are still in effect, with thousands have being displaced, borders redrawn, and a seemingly rising tension between the powers that be.
                Fortunately, you are among those with the skills needed to survive these trying times with a great deal of opportunities in more... unusual
                lines of work. With its mostly open borders, a rising industry and emphasis on personal liberties and privacy, Breland is seeing a large influx
                of folk seeking to start a new life within its borders. Gold Dust is one such town, being a small, tucked away town in the vast expanses
                of the Breland Wastes, hosting many newcomers. The town has been adjusting to its booms in population and economy nicely, but even in a small town 
                like this, such increases also bring along its fair share of crime and corruption, and the rising population makes it harder to leave alone some
                things best left undisturbed.

                Being somewhat of an upstart town, Gold Dust has little in the ways of solving unusual problems, or even mundane ones if we're being honest. Five people 
                have gone missing in the last few months, in any of a bigger settlement that would have likely gone unnoticed, and others have gone under a strange cognitive
                dissonance for a few days at a time as well. These problems have largely been chalked up to life in the wastes, and other than a couple of welfare checks, have 
                not had a serious investigation. You have found your way to Gold Dust, wether by chance or by choice, and now find yourselves tied to this town's fate.
