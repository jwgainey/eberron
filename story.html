                It has been  years since the end of the Last War. Even though the countries of Khorvaire have stopped fighting, its effects
                are still in effect, with thousands have being displaced, borders redrawn, and a seemingly rising tension between the powers that be.
                Fourtunately, you are among those with the skills needed to survive these trying times with a great deal of opportunities in more... unusual
                lines of work. With its mostly open borders, a rising industry and emphasis on personal liberties and privacy, Breland is seeing a large influx
                of folk seeking to start a new life within its borders. Gold Dust is one such town, being a small, tucked away town in the vast expanses
                of the Breland Wastes, hosting many newcomers. The town has been adjusting to its booms in population and economy nicely, but even in a small town 
                like this, such increases also bring along its fair share of crime and corruption, and the rising population makes it harder to leave alone some
                things best left undisturbed.
